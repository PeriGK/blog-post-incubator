 ## [Technical debt 101](https://medium.com/@joaomilho/festina-lente-e29070811b84)

> every time you don’t write software based on the best possible practices and understanding of the business domain, you incur it in a technical debt. This debt keeps increasing over time, just like an interest. If you ignore it long enough, you can go technically bankrupt

> creator of the analogy, Ward Cunningham

> The main misconception of this analogy is that technical debt is what you get when you write bad code. This is completely wrong. Technical debt is a way to make design trade-off decisions in a clear, manageable way.  **la deuda técnica no es escribir mal código, es una decisión de diseño**

> Technical debt can be paid by refactoring. But when code is just bad, refactoring is way, way harder.

> So, the only realistic solution to legacy code is about radically improving the current code base in cycles, not a *big rewrite*. Big rewrites don't work as expected
