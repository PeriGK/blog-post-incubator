58. Create a list of PHP_CodeSniffer rules available by default, and then reply this StackOverflow question (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16427207/php-codesniffer-rules-documentation), `-s` option outputs sniff codes in the report, and that will help to identify them. Looking at the source code, under Standards folder, each standard has a `ruleset.xml` file, that includes all rules with their indexes. Very nice place to look for rules to include/exclude
