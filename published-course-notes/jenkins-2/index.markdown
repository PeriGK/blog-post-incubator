# [Getting started with Jenkins 2](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/jenkins-2-getting-started), Pluralsight course

##### by [Wes Higbee](http://www.weshigbee.com/)

## Objectives

Learn how to configure and use Pipelines, a new feature in Jenkins 2

## Review

Short course to scratch the surface of Jenkins 2 Pipelines (and very little about Blue Ocean, the new GUI).

The course pace is a bit slow, specially at the beggining. By the end of the course, the topics are a bit complex,
and the needed tools to execute the desired tasks are not reallly easy to install and use. But Wes did a great 
job and made it as easiest as possible, creating a good balance between complexity, usefulness, interesting stuff,...

At the beginning, there were basic topcis. I'd skip them if I knew about Jenkins. Later in the course,
it was much more interesting.

## Learned topics

- Basic pipelines in Jenkins 2
- Some basic pipelines steps: `sh`, `node`, `stash`, `archive`,...
- Create Jenkins Agents (master-slave machines)
