##### by [Emily Bache](http://coding-is-like-cooking.info/)

## Objectives

Learn about coding dojos. They're a great tool to learn and teach programming, and to learn/teach TDD.

What about hosting a Global Day of Code Retreat?

## Review

It starts with basic concepts (this is starting to be the norm) about TDD, tests, different development games,...

Emily explains aobut different games to practice while coding, to learn programming and to learn how to solve problems.

The most interesting part is when she shows how to host a set of 5 or more codign dojos, with their objectives, tools, katas, games,...

## Learned topics

Emily adds a new phase to TDD, additionally to the typical three: red, green, refactor. It's called *overview*. In this phase you think about a list of tests (to do incremental development), decides what test to write next,...

Randori in pairs: that's the way almost all code retreats and coding dojos are hosted.
