## Notas tomadas del libro

> Cómo esta hecho es tan importante como el hacerlo ~ *Namur*

## 1. Software Development in the Twenty-First Century

*Seniority* es transitiva y relativa. Transitiva porque los clientes querrán distintos tipos de sistemas conforme avanze la tecnología. Relativa porque cuando intentamos identificar cómo es un desarrollador senior necesitamos hacernos las siguientes preguntas: senior comparado con quién? en qué tecnología? en qué contexto?

Los roles y las responsabilidades de un programador se han hecho más amplias y más importantes, haciendo que los programadores se sientan orgullosos de ser programadores.

## 2. Agile

Agile no soluciona todos los problemas, solo los hace más evidentes.

Generalizando especialistas: ser bueno escribiendo código es lo mínimo que se espera de un programador *profesional*. Testing, análisis, entender a negocio, buenas dotes comunicativas y una personalidad más extrovertida son otras habilidades requeridas.

En un trasformación Agile como nos venden ahora, no hay cambios técnicos. Lo que lleva a que siguen existiendo los mismos problemas de siempre.

Para los programadores sí, tienen un mejor proceso de trabajo y hablan entre ellos más a menudo. Aparte de eso, en término de trabajo técnico que realizan, no ha cambiado mucho la cosa.

Todas esas consultoras y coaches hacen muy poco o nada para ayudar a las empresas a ser mejores y a escribir software de calidad.

Las transformaciones Agile estaban enfocadas en procesos pero no en disciplinas técnicas.

Sin excelencia técnica, cualquier proyecto software será una experiencia dolorosa, frustrantte y cara.

Un mecanismo de feedback rápido es clave para cualquier compañía que quiera ser Agile. Reaccionar a ese feedback rápido es lo que les hace verdaderamente Agile.

Las metodologías ágiles ayudan a las empresas a hacer lo correcto, mientras que Software Craftsmanship ayuda a los programadores y empresas a hacer las cosas de la forma correcta.

## 3. Software Craftsmanship

- esta casi puede resumir l libro
- Software Craftsmanship is all about putting responsibility, professionalism, pragmatism, and pride back into software development.
- muy interesante este capitulo dobre historia
- Software Craftsmanship History
- The focus on high-quality software must be the number one priority if you want long-lived applications.
- Great developers want to work with other great developers. Great developers want to work for great companies.

## 4. The Software Craftsmanship Attitude

- caring about and being proud of the work we do is a given.
- nlah blah blah... es un echo
- finding ways to become better professionals is a lifetime commitment.
- Satisfying and helping our customers to achieve what they want to achieve, in the most efficient way, is our main goal.
- Sharing our knowledge with less-experienced software craftsmen is our moral obligation.
- In this chapter I discuss how we can own our careers,
- y como ha dicho antes. debes tratar a tu emplesdor como si fuera un cliente
- Clients don’t pay professionals to learn.
- That means that we should use our own time and money to get better at what we do.
- Keeping our heads down, working hard from 9 to 5, and doing only what we are told to do is not professional either. That is what factory workers do. If developers want to be treated as professionals, they should start acting as professionals.
- small list of things we can do to keep ourselves up to date.
- Books, Many Books
- Technology-specific books
- Conceptual books
- new concepts, paradigms, and practices.
- Behavioral books
- better professionals in general. They help us learn how to deal with people, clients, deadlines, team members,
- Revolutionary books (some call them classics)
- Favor conceptual and behavioral books for your career progression, starting with the revolutionary ones.
- Blogs
- eso ayudara a quien vnga despues d nootros. porque encontraran los concptos dscritos con los mismos ojos ue tienen ellos ajra
- Even if developers more experienced than us have written about the subject many times before, it is worth writing whatever we are currently learning anyway.
- Know Who to Follow
- Social Media
- Practice, Practice, Practice
- when practicing, we should focus on how we are solving the problem.
- Katas
- solving katas with our current toolkit (the techniques and tools that we are comfortable with) does not make a lot of sense.
- Katas can be very beneficial when the same kata is done over and over again but using a completely different approach or technique each time.
- Pet Projects
- pet projects are meant to be fun. A common problem that developers have with pet projects is finding a good idea. The good news is that you do not need one.
- Open Source
- it is also a great way to raise your public profile.
- Pair Programming
- Instead of thinking that the other person is stupid (which is rarely the case), we should think that we are probably not as good as we think we are.
- Socialize
- there is one thing they all share: passion.
- Deliberate Discovery I’m
- hay que intentar expandir el conocimiento que tenemo en lo qieetemos trabajando.aunque creamos que lo conocmos imre hbra algun asexto ue podmos explorar
- constantly expose ourselves to situations where we can learn something new about the context we are in.
- Work-Life Balance
- Creating Time
- Focus: The Pomodoro Technique
- we focus. A good technique is to decide beforehand what we want to do before we actually use this time slot.
- teneer un buen trabajo y saber que estamos a la ultima nosnda confianza y esaremos tranquilos para disfrutar del tiempo libte
- Keeping our professional life healthy is essential for a healthy family life.

## 5. Heroes, Goodwill, and Professionalism

- Learning How to Say No
- Even knowing deep inside that it will be almost impossible to deliver all the features by the imposed date, developers end up agreeing and committing to it.
- An Epic Failure
- Lesson Learned
- a vecces no decimos que no porque queremos creer que somos los mejores
- Deep inside we wanted to show how good we were.
- Being Professional
- Very often we have to deal with very hard deadlines. The best way to deal with them is to analyze everything that needs to be done and communicate all the possible risks we see and concerns we may have.
- Providing Options
- Always saying no is also not a professional attitude. Every no, ideally, should be followed by a list of alternatives.
- At the end of the day, we should all focus on solving the problem, regardless of which solution we choose or who proposed it.
- An Unexpected and Viable Option
- Enlightened Managers
- Managers should appreciate when we say we cannot deliver some features.
- Transparency helps managers and the team to prepare for tough situations.
- Good managers are part of the team. They stay with the team during good and bad times.

## 6. Working Software

- truth is that in a software project, the most important deliverable is the software itself. Anything else is secondary.
- Working Software Is Not Enough
- All that legacy code you need to deal with on a daily basis counts as working software.
- con todo este parrsfo. te puedes hacer una idea de lonque quiere decir ue working software no s suficinte
- All that legacy code you need to deal with on a daily basis counts as working software. Imagine all those applications that take us a long time to add a new feature to. All those applications we are scared to touch. All those applications that are fragile or tightly coupled. And what about those applications without an extensive test suite, where we are forced to test manually? What about those applications that we need to deploy into user acceptance testing (UAT) if we wanted to test it because we cannot run it locally? They are all working software.
- Rather than construction, programming is more like gardening. —The Pragmatic Programmer
- The lower the quality, the higher the number of bugs, and the harder it is to test.
- some people say that they don’t have time to do it properly, but it seems that they always find a way to justify the amount of time and money spent on long testing and bug-fixing phases.
- business progress is being impeded or delayed by software instead of being helped by it.
- The biggest problem here is that bad code is invisible to everyone besides the developers.
- That means it is the developers’ responsibility to look after the quality of the code.
- Over time, I realized that developers have a wrong notion of time. We always think we are under pressure.
- more often than not, the pressure is self-imposed.
- We think we never have the time to do things right.
- even having the time, developers decide not to automate their tests.
- por eso dice que no hacer testd es ser egocentrico
- They just think about their own tasks, not about all the other people involved in the project and all the time they will spend
- When looking at legacy code, instead of moaning and getting frustrated, we should try to understand it and make it better, constantly applying the Boy Scout
- latter. It is easy to say that a piece of code is badly written. It is easy to complain or even laugh. But the question is: are you good enough to make it better?

## 7. Technical Practices

- no se puede medir la caoidad del codigo con practicas no tcnigas . daily meeting. backlog...
- we cannot measure the quality of our applications through the practices
- no se puede medir la caoidad del codigo con practicas no tcnigas . daily meeting. backlog... ellas nos ayudan a construir the right thing
- Software Craftsmanship complements Agile by focusing on technical practices and providing a quick and short feedback loop on the quality of our code. Technical practices help us to make sure we are building the thing right.
- The truth is, very few Agile coaches and consultancy companies are good enough to teach XP practices.
- Practices must be backed by values,
- We recognize someone’s values according to his or her actions and not by what they say. Practices are the validation of values.
- Trying to sell technical practices for what they are is pointless.
- Don’t focus on the practices themselves when trying to convince managers or team members to adopt them. Focus the discussion on the benefit they bring and how they compare to the practices they currently have.
- Automated Testing
- confidence to add new features without breaking the system.
- Automated testing gives us measurable business value.
- Test First
- Writing tests first helps us to just write enough code to satisfy the requirements, keeping the code simple. It reduces complexity and overengineering.
- Test-Driven Development
- Complexity in our code and bad design choices are highlighted by the complexity in maintaining and writing new tests. These tests lead us to re-analyze the design of our code and refactor to make it simpler.
- provides a living and executable documentation for our applications and, as a good side effect, a rich suite of regression tests.
- Continuous Integration
- the combination of continuous integration and TDD can make an entire QA team redundant.
- Pair Programming
- improve the collective understanding of the entire system and level up developers’ skills. It also helps developers to define and maintain coding standards.
- Refactoring
- hablando de refacorizar.es importante. pero nonhace falta refactorizar todo el sistema
- The Boy Scout rule should just be applied when we need to make a change or understand one area of the code, not everywhere.
- A clean and maintainable code enables developers to go fast and reduces the chances of new bugs.
- Accountability
- 4 cosas . aportar valor. feedback loops muy cortos. inspect y adaptarse
- Summary

## 8. The Long Road
- the long and hard road to mastery.
- Focus and Determination
- But What if We Don’t Know Where We Are Going?
- si no sábes donde vas no puedes guiarte. pero tampoco consideres tu meta como algo fijo. revisa tus objetivos
- Defining the direction we want to go in our careers is important.
- But What if We Don’t Know Where We Are Going?
- When we are not so sure where we want to go with our careers, we need to start opening doors.
- We need to go out there and speak to people.
- Job as Investment
- The most important thing is to treat every single job as an investment, a step toward a bigger goal.
- Expecting a return on investment from jobs should not be mistaken for the selfish and unprofessional attitude known as “CV building,”
- Knowledge is the most common return on investment expected from a job. Developers choose jobs according to what they want to learn, and they leave their jobs either when they are not learning anymore
- Autonomy, Mastery, and Purpose
- esto es lo qu motiva a lo trabajadore del conociminto
- Our careers will always be more important than any specific job or company.
- Our careers are like long staircases and our jobs are the steps.
- “the Peter Principle,” and its effect could be stated as “employees tend to be given more authority until they cannot work competently.” In other words, through political games, misappropriation of credit, hiding incompetence by blaming others, and often unprofessional and dishonest attitudes, some people are promoted to positions for which they are totally incompetent.
- Summary
- Part II. A Full Transformation

## 9. Recruitment

- An Ordinary Job Description
- Although every company would say that they want the best people, they have no idea what that really means. And a proof of that is how they advertise their job openings.
- There is also a general perception that recruitment processes take too long.
- Too Busy to Interview
- if you cannot allocate enough time to interview, you can’t really be serious about building a great team.
- Job candidates
- Job candidates are always judged from a biased perspective:
- The time wasted interviewing wrong candidates is the problem we must address.
- No Job Descriptions
- Job descriptions are anti-patterns.
- Here are some reasons:
- Absolute numbers:
- Keyword matching:
- Listing technologies:
- Wrong cultural fit criteria:
- Listing the wrong requirements:
- Listing the responsibilities required
- is a far better way to attract better developers.
- Wrong filters:
- No internal promotions:
- What if a Job Description Is Needed?
- the focus should be on detailing the expected attitude and responsibilities, types of projects, technologies used (not required), and values and culture of the company.
- A Job Is Not Just a Job
- For great developers, their job is not just a job; it’s also their hobby and their passion.
- will look for companies that think in the same way
- Community Involvement
- Supporting user groups and technical communities is a great way to attract and approach great developers.
- Defining Effective Filtering Criteria
- Whichever filter criteria we apply, we will always filter some good developers out.
- de ahi q sea mejor ser proactivo
- The problem is that when you are in desperation mode, you increase dramatically the risk of making mistakes, especially when it comes to recruitment.
- Good developers are also filtering bad companies out and looking for the best ones.

## 10. Interviewing Software Craftsmen
- A Business Negotiation
- During an interview, it is important to understand that we are not begging for a job. We are doing a business negotiation.
- pregubtas a hscer al empleador en la entrevidta
- ask questions about how we work, what we do, what we want to achieve, and what our main problems are,
- por lo q hay q prestar atencion a ciertos detalles
- Every company is great when we talk to recruiters,
- management team does not trust developers, and that formal hierarchies govern the company, is when interviewers are managers, architects, and team leaders,
- Single interview processes always make me a bit worried. It seems that the company is in a hurry
- interviewers who ask questions that are totally unrelated to the job offered.
- interviewer is following a script—asking
- If the interview is composed of questions that any person could answer correctly after a quick search on Google, or after reading the APIs of a language or the documentation of a tool, the questions have absolutely no value in identifying good or bad developers.
- Good Interviews
- The Right Focus
- If there is anything we want to change, improve, or adopt, the new people hired should be our allies in achieving that.
- Mind-Mapping a Conversation
- One technique I find very useful when conducting interviews (or should I say conversations) is mind-mapping.
- Pair-Programming Interview
- Bring Your Own Computer
- Developers who write code outside working hours will always have all their tools installed and ready to go.
- Tailor-Made Interviews
- apostr a algo
- Taking a Punt
- When interviewing, we should look for talent, attitude, passion, and potential, not knowledge of specific technologies.
- Pre-Interview Coding Exercises
- There will be cases where some candidates will decide not to go forward with the selection process
- Everyone Should Know How to Interview
- Experienced developers should always take less-experienced developers to the interviews with them.
- Developers Must Interview Developers
- en todo caso eligrn a alguien mejor que ellos
- Good developers don’t hire bad developers.

## 11. Interview Anti-Patterns

- financial offer, autonomy, mastery, purpose, productive partnership, talented and passionate people, and a good working environment are some of the things they will consider before accepting any offer.
- Don’t Be a Smart-Ass Interviewer
- you should be looking for a partner,
- Don’t Use Brainteasers
- Avoid stupid questions that are totally unrelated to the job.
- Don’t Ask Questions to Which You Don’t Know the Answers
- Don’t Try to Make the Candidate Look Like a Fool
- Don’t Block the Internet
- Don’t Code on a Piece of Paper
- Don’t Use Algorithms
- what are the things we value the most?
- en lugar de ellos pregunta por los valorws q estas buscando
- Don’t Conduct Phone Interviews

## 12. The Cost of Low Morale

- The Agile Hangover: Low Morale
- few years after their Agile adoption, many of these companies realized that their software delivery capability was still very poor.
- The sad reality is, for certain companies, the outcome of their Agile adoption was developers mechanically following a new process, but still developing software exactly how they were before.
- The Cost of Employing 9-to-5 Developers
- Constrained by Lack of Motivation
- Injecting Passion
- Instead of just telling others what to do, software craftsmen can sit down and pair with other developers, sharing their knowledge, experience, and passion.
- Software craftsmen are always talking about software and are willing to share the things they are doing to better themselves.
- The best person to motivate a developer is another developer. A good developer. A software craftsman.
- If you want to bring passion and motivation to a development team, make sure you bring in a few craftsmen to join them.

## 13. Culture of Learning

- Wrong Motivation
- we will never change an organization by forcing people to adopt a new process or different practices.
- Creating a Culture of Learning
- Creating a culture of learning is one of the most efficient ways of injecting passion into a company.
- instead of having managers trying to impose how, when, and what developers should learn, companies should empower developers to create their own culture of learning.
- Let developers decide how, when, and what they want to learn.
- Start a Book Club
- Have a Tech Lunch (Brown Bag Session)
- don’t make this meeting about work. Make it about learning.
- Have Group Discussions (Roundtables)
- Switch Projects for an Iteration
- After a period of time, projects fall into a routine;
- Having different people joining an existing project, even if for a small period of time, makes the members of the team rethink their problems and solutions
- Switch Projects for a Few Hours
- Conduct Group Code Reviews
- The focus is on how to make the code better and not to say why it sucks.
- Have Hands-On Coding Sessions
- The facilitator will choose an exercise, normally a kata, and add some twist (constraints) to it just to spice things
- Favor Technology-Agnostic Thinking
- Start Internal Communities of Practice
- don’t focus on growing the community. Focus on having fun and running good sessions.
- Encourage Pet-Project Time
- Engage with External Technical Communities
- What if Others Don’t Want to Join In?
- If you think you are going to change an entire organization
- That’s not going to happen. However, you can help some people to (re)discover their passion and
- Be an Example
- lead by example.
- Focus on Those Who Care
- Once a few people are having fun, working well together, and using different techniques and approaches, more people will want to join.
- Don’t Force
- Don’t get disappointed or angry with developers who don’t want to join in. Keep your own motivation up,
- Don’t Try to Change Everyone
- Avoid Consensus Delays
- Sometimes it is just not possible to accommodate everyone.
- Don’t Ask for Authorization
- to learn and practice on your own time.
- Don’t Complicate
- Establish a Rhythm

## 14. Driving Technical Changes
- Many developers suffer from what Kent Beck calls adolescent surety. They think they have the secret formula for delivering great software and nothing else is worth considering.
- Identifying Skepticism Patterns
- The Uninformed:
- The Herd:
- they lack confidence and leave the decisions to smarter and more-experienced developers.
- The Cynic:
- They like to argue
- One of the reasons for them not to adopt certain practices or tools is that they don’t want to expose their own weaknesses;
- The Burned:
- The Time Crunched:
- They don’t have time to do things right but they have time to do the same things over and over again.
- The Boss:
- The Irrational:
- One after another, they will raise irrational points against our proposal,
- The Indifferent: The
- The Indifferent: The Indifferent simply doesn’t care.
- indifference leads to lousy implementations of good ideas, transforming those good ideas into very bad ones.
- The Wronged:
- don’t like the company and never miss an opportunity to badmouth
- do things that can harm the project
- The Inept:
- The Ivory-Tower Architect:
- haven’t written a single line of production code for years
- If it is not their idea, it’s probably not a good one.
- The Insecure:
- They are worried about being replaced or losing their status.
- They see software craftsmen as a threat and will do whatever they can to discredit them.
- The Fanboy:
- devoted to a single subject (or point of view) in a fanatic manner,
- the only thing they know well,
- Be Prepared
- Encourage simplicity.
- Your idea or proposal must be simple and clear.
- Speak the same language.
- Do your homework.
- Make sure you understand what you are talking about. Research, try, and practice.
- Be respectful.
- Learn how to listen.
- Where Do We Start?
- Establish Trust
- the best way to build trust (with fellow developers, delivery managers, or clients) is by consistently delivering quality software.
- is not enough
- You need to expose yourself. You need to be visible. You need to demonstrate how passionate you are
- is not enough either.
- They need to feel you can lead them.
- Gain Expertise
- Before proposing a new technology, make sure you really understand it. Play with it, build something with it, talk to experts,
- Lead by Example
- Choose Your Battles
- Trying to do everything at the same time wasn’t just impractical but also impossible.
- Iterate, Inspect, and Adapt
- iteration boundary trick: “Let’s try this approach for one iteration and then we revisit.”
- Proposing gradual changes reduces the amount of resistance and minimizes the risk—changes
- Fear and Incompetence
- How Do I Convince My Manager?
- easier to ask for forgiveness than to get permission.
- The more technical details you expose, the more managers feel they should micromanage you.
- How Do I Convince My Team to Do TDD?
- “Let’s just try it anyway, just for fun.”
- Share with her that great feeling of seeing the red bar turning into green.
- Show how awesome it is to be able to refactor the code without the fear
- Take the opportunity to Ping-Pong
- Make sure you have fun together.
- Facing the Skeptics
- The Ivory-Tower Architect
- will probably be the most difficult skeptic to deal with.
- Responsibility versus Accountability
- si va bien es gracias al arquitecto. si va ml es culpa de los desarrolladores
- Ivory-Tower Architects become responsible for the solution while the developers are the ones who are accountable for it.
- Real software professionals understand that responsibility should always come with accountability.
- The Wronged
- They are not against you; they are against the company.
- There is not much we can do about it besides trying to make them excited again.
- Should We Really Care about All That?
- ete capitulo estria bien repasarlo cada ve que tenmos que incluir un cambio técnico 
- Being good at what we do, being able to communicate clearly, and, most important, being able to establish trust are essential skills for any developer willing to drive changes.

## 15. Pragmatic Craftsmanship

- Quality Is Always Expected
- No manager or client expects bad-quality software. Regardless of what they say, they will always expect high quality.
- ni siquiera tu. cuando compras alo. si dees eleir entr barto o d calida . elige arato. ero esperas cierta clidad
- Busting the “Expensive and Time-Consuming Quality” Myth
- Because every feature is test-driven,
- there is no time wasted manually testing the application and fixing existing bugs. Applications developed without tests demand longer cycles of manual testing
- The bigger the application is, the faster software craftsmen will be, when compared to developers who don’t use XP.
- Do We Need to Test-Drive Everything?
- Refactoring
- there is no point in opening a piece of code that you don’t need to change and spending days refactoring
- de ahi.  refactorizar too... hay un cacho
- we should always leave at least the area of code we changed cleaner than we found it.
- The “One Way” of Developing Software
- Good practices and processes are good until we find better ones to replace them.
- TDD and all the XP practices
- are the practices we use and advocate but that doesn’t mean we should stop looking for ways to improve.
- Helping the Business
- We should be able to change the code almost as fast as they change their minds, giving the business an opportunity to visualize their ideas
- A Simple and Quick Solution
- Changing the code every time they changed their mind was easy as the code was simple, well crafted, and fully tested.
- Software Projects Are Not about Us
- We need to think about who is going to maintain the software when we leave.
- Great Versus Mediocre
- What distinguishes great and mediocre developers is how they make things work.
- Four Rules of Simple Design
- Design Patterns
- se queja de soluciones sobredimnsionadas. creo que va hacia domain driven design en lugar de patrones de diseño
- Look at all the legacy code we see out there today. It is far easier to identify the design patterns used by the developers than the actual business features they were trying to satisfy.
- Refactoring to Patterns
- There will be a few parts of the code where the effort of introducing abstractions earlier will pay off,
- The pragmatic approach would be to only introduce abstractions when they are really needed.
- Craftsmanship and Pragmatism
- TDD doesn’t slow developers down. Typing is not a bottleneck. Learning and mastering a new skill, practice, or technology is.

## 16. A Career As a Software Craftsman

- Being a Craftsman
- Passion. That summarizes it all.
- Software craftsmen are humble, always ready to learn from more-experienced developers, and eager to help the less experienced.
- Being a craftsman means to be curious and experiment with new things.
- It means to be pragmatic,
- Honesty and Courage
- Honesty and courage are essential qualities of a software craftsman.
- saying “no”
- clients that what they are asking for is unrealistic
- not going to commit to, or be responsible for, something that we don’t feel is right.
- simply saying “no” is also not a craftsman’s attitude. A “no” should always be followed by a “but.”
- Career Progression
- Different Ladders
- “I’m 35,” I said loudly, “and I’m very proud to be a failure.”
- no tengas mieo de ser viejo y seguir programndo. no tengas miedo de hacer lo qu t gusa
- Different Ladders
- Developers who, for one reason or another, decide to take roles as managers or architects are not climbing up the software development ladder; they are switching ladders.
- Roads and Milestones
- inrentar resumitlo en una frade
- For many developers, looking for a new job means, “I will offer my current knowledge and time in exchange for the highest salary I can get.” That’s very shortsighted. For professionals who are interested in long and successful careers, a job is far more than that. It’s a constant investment in their careers. Besides the things we are paid for, we should also invest all our dedication, passion, commitment, and knowledge we acquire outside working hours to make our workplace a better place—a
- always tried to offer more, to do more, and to make sure everyone around me would become better.
- Throughout my career, I chose each one of my jobs very carefully.
- I never sent a whole bunch of CVs to many different companies with the expectation that at least one of them would make me an offer. I was focused.
- Building Our Careers, One Job at a Time
- Each job is a milestone, a step in a ladder.
- My advice is to stay in a job for as long as it remains aligned with our individual career aspirations.
- What if We Don’t Know Where We Want to Go?
- There is just one thing you can do when you are in this situation: open yourself up and meet people.
- community events.
- contributing to open source
- mailing lists.
- You will see that there is a whole world out there, full of amazing people, and with opportunities you never considered before.
- Job Diversity
- lo contrario a la especialuzacion
- Moving from project to project, experiencing different environments, companies, industries, technologies, and approaches to software, is what I would consider to be the craftsman’s journey.
- The Mission
- not just about clients—that’s just one part of it. The real mission of a software craftsman is to make a contribution to raise the bar of the software industry, with professionalism, passion, and care.

## A. Craftsmanship Myths and Further Explanations

- Software Craftsman versus Software Developers
- Every craftsman is a developer but not every developer is a craftsman. Contrary to what many people think, this has nothing to do with seniority or skills. The difference is more about the attitude each developer has towards his or her profession.
- Elitism
- Apprentice, Journeyman, and Master
- The relationship between “mentors” and “apprentices” is used far more often, and represent far better what we believe.
- Master Craftsman
- Narrow Focus
- Craftsmanship versus XP
- Craftsmanship is an ideology. XP is a methodology.
- peo comonha dicjo ntes. un craftman pone todo en duda y si encuentra un practica mejor. abandon la actual y aprende la nyeva
- professional attitude is totally related to the practices we use, and currently, the majority of these practices are XP practices.
- Attachment to Practices
- Software craftsmen are not attached to practices. They are attached to the value that those practices give them.
- whenever we find practices that could give us more value than the XP practices, we are more than happy to adopt them.
- Agile Coaches and Managers
- Software Apprenticeships
- The Problem with Metaphors
