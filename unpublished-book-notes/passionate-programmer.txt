
This book is about finding fulfillment and happiness in your career. Fulfillment and happiness don’t (often) come by chance. They require thought, intention, action, and a willingness to change

You might make more money if you follow this advice. You might gain more recognition or even become famous. But please don’t forget that these are not the goals. They’re a means to an end.

At least when starting out, greatness is binary in the music world. A musician wants to either be great (and famous for it!) or not do it at all. I’m often asked why it is that there are so many good musicians who are also good software developers. That’s the reason.

To excel at a company, you’re going to have to understand how you fit into the business’s plan to make money.

Think of your career as if it is the life cycle of a product that you are creating. That product is made up of you and your skills.

Choose your market. Pick the technologies and the business domains

Invest in your product. Your knowledge and skills

# Part 1 Choosing Your Market

Which technologies should we invest in? Which domain should we develop expertise in? Should we go broad or deep with our knowledge? These are questions we really should be asking ourselves.

## Tip 1:   Lead or Bleed?

the difference between choosing technologies that are still on the bleeding edge and technologies that are firmly entrenched. Picking a stable technology that has already wedged itself into the production systems of businesses worldwide is a safer, but potentially less rewarding, choice than picking a flashy new technology that nobody has deployed yet.

what about the technologies that have run their courses?

the old systems don’t just die. They are replaced.

Someone has to know how to make the new speak to the old, and vice versa.

there’s a role to be filled by a calculating technologist: technology hospice.

Act on It!

Make a list of early, middle, and late adoption technologies based on today’s market. Map them out on paper from left to right; the left is bleeding edge, and the right is filled by technologies that are in their sunsets.

Are there any technologies around the far edges that you have some special interest in?

## Tip 2:   Supply and Demand

There are usually more buyers for any given thing at a lower price than at a higher one.

The offshore software trend has just injected a large supply of low-cost IT people into our economy.

You can’t compete on price. You can’t afford it. So, what do you do?

puedes decir india o suramerica. ellos buscan tecnoologias muy establecidas para competir en precio

India caters to the already balanced IT services markets. You don’t find mainstream Indian offshoring companies jumping on unconventional technologies.

Based on this observation, you might choose to compete in segments of the job market in which there is actually lower demand.

sound, if you’re worried about losing employment to offshoring, one strategy would be to avoid the types of work that offshore companies are doing.

change the focus of the competition from price to ability.

You can’t compete on price, but you can compete on ability.

with the average price of these mainstream programmers decreasing, the demand will increase. An overall increase in demand

might actually result in more jobs (of a certain type) at home,

To make offshoring work well, many companies realize the need for a reserve of high-end, onshore developers who can set standards, ensure quality, and provide technical leadership.

competition would shift from price to ability.

Act on It!

Use job posting and career websites to find out which skills are in high demand and in low demand.

Make note of which skills appear to be in high demand domestically with little penetration offshore.

## Tip 3:   Coding Don’t Cut It Anymore

If you want to stay relevant, you’re going to have to dive into the domain of the business you’re in.

You should think of your business domain experience as an important part of your repertoire.

You should put the same level of care into selecting which industry to serve as you put into selecting which technologies to master.

the company and industry you choose to work for becomes a significant investment on your part.

Act on It!

businessperson. Talk to them about how they do their job.

ask yourself what you would have to change or learn if you aspired to have their job.

Do this regularly. This may seem like an awkward or uncomfortable idea. That’s OK. I

Do this regularly.

Pick up a trade magazine for your company’s industry.

Make lists of questions you can ask your management or business clients.

What’s the hot new issue right now? Whatever it is, bring it up with your business clients. Ask them to explain it and to give you their opinions.

## Tip 4:   Be the Worst

Legendary jazz guitarist Pat Metheny

“Always be the worst guy in every band you’re in.”

I would fit in. I wouldn’t stand out among the other musicians as a star.

I would fit in. I wouldn’t stand out among the other musicians as a star. On the other hand, I wouldn’t be obviously outclassed, either.

The more interesting reason that I would fit in with these superior musicians—my heroes, in some cases—is that my playing would transform itself to be more like theirs.

learned from this that people can significantly improve or regress in skill, purely based on who they are performing with. And, prolonged experience

Act on It!

Find a “be the worst” situation

find a volunteer project on which you can work with other developers who will make you better

Pick an open source project

Go through the project’s to-do list

Make your design and code so indistinguishable from the rest of the project

You’ll be amazed at what you can learn from a remote set of senior developers,

## Tip 5:   Invest in Your Intelligence

why else would you want to invest in fringe technologies that you may rarely or never have an opportunity to actually get paid to use?

exposure to these fringe technologies and methodologies actually makes you deeper, better, smarter, and more creative.

Act on It!

Learn a new programming language.

Ask old-timers to review your code and make suggestions that would make it more idiomatically correct.

## Tip 6:   Don’t Listen to Your Parents

your parents are going to give you fear-driven advice.

your parents are going to give you fear-driven advice. Fear-driven advice is geared toward not losing. Thinking about not losing is not the way to win! Winners take risks.

Another career decision-making factor that is likely not in line with your parents’ view of the working world is that it’s OK (and often preferable) to change jobs.

And if you’re not having fun, you’re not going to be excellent.

Act on It!

What are your biggest career fears? Think about the last few career choices you made.

What would you have done if fear had not been a factor?

## Tip 7:   Be a Generalist

software projects are usually very cyclical. Not only is the actual flow of projects cyclical, but the work inside a project is cyclical.

The way to become a generalist is to not label yourself with a specific role or technology.

First, you can choose to either be a leader or manager type or be a technical person.

Being a UNIX Guy who refuses to do Windows is increasingly more impractical.

Longevity is going to require that you are platform neutral in the workplace.

It’s rare, and refreshing, to find a developer who truly understands the platform on which he or she is working.

Act on It!

list the dimensions on which you may or may not be generalizing your knowledge and abilities. For each dimension, write your specialty.

to the right of your specialty, write one or more topics you should put into your “To Learn” list.

## Tip 8:   Be a Specialist

Unfortunately, the software industry has churned out a whole lot of these shallow specialists, who use the term specialist as an excuse for knowing only one thing.

I wanted someone who, when dealing with high-level abstractions, would also understand the low-level details of what went into the implementation of those abstractions.

Act on It!

Whether your language relies on a VM or not, take some time to study just what happens when you compile a source file.

teach a class on some aspect of a technology that you would like to develop some depth in.

, teaching is one of the best ways to learn.
## Tip 9:   Don’t Put All Your Eggs in Someone Else’s Basket

we fool ourselves into thinking market leader is the same thing as standard. So, to some people, it seems rational to make another company’s product part of their identities.

although a single-minded investment in one particular technology is almost always a bad idea, if you must do so, consider focusing on an open source option,

You start to realize that these concepts and patterns that your brain is sorting through and making sense of are much more scalable and universal than any specific vendor’s technology.

You start to realize that these concepts and patterns that your brain is sorting through and making sense of are much more scalable and universal than any specific vendor’s technology.

Act on It!

Try a small project, twice. Try it once in your home base technology and then once, as idiomatically as possible, in a competing technology.

## Tip 10:   Love It or Leave It

You have to be passionate about your work if you want to be great at your work.

I was obsessed with learning anything and everything I could.

This was the difference between me and my overeducated, underperforming colleagues at work. Passion.

We can’t all be Mozart or Coltrane. But, we can all take a big step away from mediocrity by finding work we are passionate about.

Act on It! Go find a job

Act on It!

find a job you’re actually passionate about.

The structured me who invests in his abilities (even as a hobby) completely wipes the floor with the me who bets it all on natural talent and ability.

## Tip 11:   Learn to Fish

Lao Tzu said, “Give a man a fish; feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish; feed him for a lifetime.”

The most obvious place to start is in learning the tools of your trade.

Source control,

It’s an integral part of your development process. Don’t let such an important thing—the authoritative repository of your work—be like voodoo to you.

A particularly easy way to get lazy is to use a lot of wizards that generate code for you.

imagine how much faster you could go if you actually knew the ins and outs of the business domain you’re working

Act on It!

You can ask yourself two extremely useful questions about any given area to drill down into the murky layers: How does it work? and Why does this (have to) happen?

time—Pick one of the most critical but neglected tools in your toolbox to focus on.

allot yourself a small period of time each day to learn one new thing about the tool

## Tip 12:   Learn How Businesses Really Work

Act on It!

One such book that I found particularly useful (and pleasantly short) is The Ten-Day MBA: A Step-By-step Guide To Mastering The Skills Taught In America’s Top Business Schools [Sil99].

## Tip 13:   Find a Mentor

Without a role model, there’s no incentive to get better.

A mentor can also give structure to your learning process.

not only do you create a personal attachment and responsibility to your mentor, but the reverse happens as well.

Act on It!

Mentoring yourself—We’d

## Tip 14:   Be a Mentor

The simple act of speaking is a known elixir for treating an unclear mind.

We learn by teaching. It’s ironic, because we expect a teacher to already know things.

We look for analogies to express complex concepts,

You find a mentee not by going out and declaring yourself a guru but by being knowledgeable and willing to patiently share that knowledge.

Keep in mind, though, that mentoring is about people.

Act on It!

Look for someone to take under your wing.

Start helping. Become known for your desire and ability to patiently help people learn.

## Tip 15:   Practice, Practice, Practice

Our industry tends to practice on the job.

if I sit down to practice coding and nothing but elegant code comes out, I’m probably sitting somewhere near the center of my current capabilities instead of the edges, where a good practice session should place me.

how do you know what to practice?

I’d break jazz practice down into the following categories (simplified for the nonmusicians among us): Physical/coordination Sight reading Improvisation

Physical/coordination:

What about the dusty corners of your primary programming language that you rarely visit?

Regular expressions

your language’s APIs or function libraries.

how about stream libraries, network programming APIs, or even the set of utilities available for dealing with collections or lists?

Sight reading:

open source software? How about trying to add a feature? Go look at the to-do list for a piece of software you’d like to practice with, and give yourself a constrained amount of time to implement the new feature (or at least to determine what it would take to implement

After choosing a feature, download the source code for the software, and start exploring. How do you know where to look? What tricks do you use to find your way around a significant body of code? What’s your starting place?

The real goal is to understand what you’re looking at as quickly as possible.

Improvisation:

taking some structure or constraint and creating something new, on the fly, on top of that structure.

Pick a simple program, and try to write it with these constraints.

You have to make time for practice. It’s your responsibility.

Act on It!

## Tip 16:   The Way That You Do It

Dave has created twenty-one such kata and has made them available for free on his weblog (http://codekata.pragprog.com/).

The truth is that for a software process to have any chance of being implemented successfully, it has to be embraced by the people who are using the process—people

The best way to feel ownership of processes is to help implement them.

Alternatively, you might work in an environment where a process is passed down from on high.

Again, this is an opportunity to take the initiative.

The best process to follow is the one that makes your team most productive and results in the best products.

The only way to find that hybrid (short of revelationary epiphany) is to study the available options, pick out the pieces that make sense to you and your team, and continuously refine them based on real experience.

Act on It!

pues aqui temos una oportunidsd para desarrollar un carrera

It’s much easier to find someone who can make software work than it is to find someone who can make the making of software work.

## Tip 17:   On the Shoulders of Giants

Studying the work of masters is an essential part of becoming a master.

Software design and programming have a lot in common with the arts in this way.

tienen en comun que hy mucho marerial de maestros ue se puede estudiar

The act of learning from the work that came before you works well in the arts world,

As you look at this code with a critical eye, you will start to develop your own tastes, just as you would for music, art, or literature.

Sir Isaac Newton said, “If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.” Smart guys like Isaac know that there is much to be learned from those who came before us.

Pick a project, and read it like a book. Make notes.

Write a critique, and publish it.

como un gripo de estudio de un kengyaje de prigramacion

Find a group of like-minded people, and meet once a month.

## Tip 18:   Automate Yourself into a Job

Act on It!

If the goal is to enhance software development throughput, you can get faster people to do the work, get more people to do the work, or automate the work.

the faster programmer approach is too hard to prove, and we don’t want to encourage the add more cheap programmers approach. This leaves us with automation.

Act on It!

Pick a task you normally do repetitively, and write a code generator for it.

I learned that no matter how cool the technology seemed to be, it was valuable only if it solved a real problem that was urgent and provided quantifiable benefits. Over time, this helped me change my way of thinking from being technology-centric to being solution-centric.

# Part 3 Executing

The craft we’ve chosen isn’t usually coupled with the domain in which we’re applying that craft.

This identity observation creates some subtle problems, because our macro-goals may conflict with our micro-responsibilities.

## Tip 19:   Right Now

In the case of a weekend coding race, you don’t have time to put tasks off, so you don’t. You can’t delay making a decision, so you don’t. You can’t avoid the boring work,

Create movement. Be the one who pushes. Don’t get comfortable.

Act on It!

Examine the tasks that have been sitting on it for a long time,

Find one that you could just do in between the cracks of your normal work, when you would normally be browsing the Web, checking your e-mail, or taking a long lunch.

## Tip 20:   Mind Reader

the trick was that he was only doing things that I had already said I wanted. I had just said them in ways that were subtle enough that even I didn’t realize I had said them.

Mind reading not only applies to your managers but also to your customers.

If they’re giving you the right cues, you might be able to add features that they’re either going to ask

People who can keep a project moving in the right direction without being given much guidance are highly valued and appreciated by their often overworked managers and customers.

It’s a skill worth exploring and developing.

start making some notes about what you think your users and managers are going to ask for. Be creative.

track your hit rate.

## Tip 21:   Daily Hit

Without warning his manager, he started tracking daily hits.

Simply setting a goal (daily, weekly, or whatever you’re capable of) and tracking this type of accomplishment can radically change your behavior. When

Act on It!

Think about the little nitpicky problems your team puts up with on a daily basis. Write them down.

are you doing something manually that could be automated? Write it down. How

Next week, on Monday, take the first item from the list, and do something about it. On Tuesday,

## Tip 22:   Remember Who You Work For

It’s really easy to say “Make sure your goals and your work align with the goals of your business.”

cuando dice puddle. se refier aque cambiar toda la empres pued ser muho. qu hay que empezar por partes mas pequeñas

The most obvious puddle to start with is your own team.

You most likely understand the problems the team faces.

If you’re not sure, you have one obvious place to go to find out: your manager.

The role of a good manager is to set priorities for the team, make sure the team has what it needs to get the job done, and do what it takes to keep the team motivated and productive,

Act on It!

Schedule a meeting with your manager.

understand your manager’s goals for the team

## Tip 23:   Be Where You’re At

an employee who’s always aiming for the next rung on the ladder.

He complains about the incompetence of The Management

He thinks many tasks are beneath him. He avoids them when possible

because he’s living in the next job, he’s usually doing a mediocre job in his current role.

how do you think his management is going to view him?

He’s a mediocre performer with a bad attitude.

I’ve been this guy myself to some extent.

Here’s a secret: that feeling will never end.

It’s good to have goals,

It seems backward, but keeping your mind focused on the present will get you further toward your goals than keeping your mind focused on the goal itself.

Focusing on the present allows you to enjoy the small victories of daily work life:

Act on It!

Write down your goals for your current job.

What can you have produced in this job that will be great?

Spend the week implementing these tactics in support of the long-term goal of “finishing” this job.

no entiendo muy bien el act on it deeste capitulo. objetivos del actual traajo? planificarlos...

## Tip 24:   How Good a Job Can I Do Today?

When we have more fun, we do better work. So, when we have no interest in a task, we’re bored, and our work suffers as a result.

the boring work is boring for two primary reasons.

tareas que no dejan lugsr a la imaginacoon

probably not tasks that leave much to the imagination.

tasks are not challenging.

que puddes hacer para que las taress aburridas no o sean tanto?

What if you tried to do the boring stuff perfectly?

Act on It!

visible—Turn those boring tasks into a competition with your co-workers. See who can do them better.

## Tip 25:   How Much Are You Worth?

How much money did you cause the company to save? How much more in revenues did you contribute? Is that number bigger than twice your salary?

cuantificsr el valor que aportss a la empresa

Talk to your manager about how to best quantify it.

How could you creatively save the company money?

## Tip 26:   A Pebble in a Bucket of Water

do the companies they leave actually feel a significant impact as a result of their departure. In most cases, even in critical positions, the effect is surprisingly low.

if you left tomorrow, the difference would be (on the average) no more or less impactful than if any of your co-workers left.

un consejo que le daba un super cio

you should never get too comfortable.

Attempting to be irreplaceable is a defensive maneuver that creates a hostile relationship with your employer

Act on It!

Make a note of anything for which the team is completely dependent on you.

Document, automate, or refactor each piece of code or task so that it could be easily understood by anyone on your team.

## Tip 27:   Learn to Love Maintenance

Maintenance work is typically littered with old, rotting systems and pushy end users.

departments are usually focused on reducing the cost of maintaining these systems,

Project work, on the other hand, is where you start with a nice, clean, green field.

As long as you’re keeping it running and responding to user requests in a timely fashion, maintenance mode is a place of freedom and creativity.

measurable success or failure of the system is yours to bear. When you’re maintaining a system, you can also plan for more visible improvements.

the maintenance programmer often has the opportunity to interact directly with his or her customers.

It also puts you in a prime spot for truly learning the inner workings of your business.

Act on It!

Measure, improve, measure—For the most critical application or code that you maintain, make a list of measurable factors that represent the quality of the application.

set a realistic goal, and improve the application’s (or your own) performance to meet that goal.

## Tip 28:   Eight-Hour Burn

“eight-hour burn.” The idea is that you should work so relentlessly that there is no way that you could continue longer than eight hours.

Most projects last a long time. You can’t keep up the pace of a sprint and finish a marathon.

We treat scarce resources as being more valuable, and we make more efficient use of them.

we can also apply this to our time.

It’s 10:30 a.m., and I know I’m going to be here for hours after everyone else goes home. I think I’ll check out the latest technology news for a while.

Bob Martin’s eight-hour burn places a constraint on you and gives you a strategy for dealing with that constraint. You get to work and think, I’ve only got eight hours! Go, go, go! With

As thought workers,

You might be working while you’re driving to dinner with your spouse or while you’re watching a movie.

If you work intensely every day, you’ll find that the work doesn’t follow you home.

Act on It!

Work intensely for four hours. Take an hour lunch. Then work for four more hours so intensely that you are absolutely exhausted

## Tip 29:   Learn How to Fail

The little failures we encounter also teach us what kind of failures to expect.

A craftsperson is really put to the test when the errors arise. Learning to deal with mistakes is a skill that is both highly valuable and difficult to teach.

Because we all make mistakes, we also know that everyone else makes mistakes. So, within reason, we don’t judge each other on the mistakes we make. We judge each other on how we deal with those inevitable mistakes.

es como una excepcion. cuanto antes explote. menos daño y mas barata sera

Raise the issue as early as you know about it.

Take the blame.

A problem needs a resolution. Lingering on whose fault it is only prolongs the issue.

Offer a solution.

Ask for help.

don’t let your pride make it worse by refusing help

## Tip 30:   Say “No”

The quickest path to missing your commitments is to make commitments that you know you can’t meet.

don’t want to disappoint our leaders, so we agree to impossible work being done in impossible timelines.

If I have a team member who has the strength to say “no” when that’s the truth, then I know that when they say “yes,” they really mean it.

Be courageous enough to be honest.

Act on It!

keeping a list of every commitment you make:

record both what you thought and what you were told to accept. Record when you delivered.

## Tip 31:   Don’t Panic

Like most skills, a great way to get good at it is to watch masters at work.

Now if you think about other games, particularly sports, you’ll recognize that the best players all share this quality.

Heroes never panic.

We panic because we lose perspective.

to focus all attention on the problem. To some extent, that’s a good way to solve problems. Unfortunately, it also makes the problem, no matter how small, seem more important than it is.

When something bad happens and I start to feel that sinking, stressed-out feeling that leads to panic,

I analyze the situation from the third-person perspective,

I often find that the solution simple and staring me in the face

Act on It!

Keep a panic journal.

la idea es identificar las fuentes de panico antes d que ocurrn

Each day at a specific time (use a calendar with a reminder!), open up a text file and record any situation that caused you to panic, even if only a little bit.

## Tip 32:   Say It, Do It, Show It

If you don’t have a deadline, you don’t have any pressure or much incentive to finish something.

a plan can make the difference between confused ambiguity at the start of a workday and clear-headed confidence when attacking the tasks ahead.

Plans don’t have to be big and drawn out.

Plans don’t have to cover a large span of time.

move the incomplete items from today (if they’re still relevant) onto tomorrow’s list, and start the process again.

Having established a rhythm of plan and attack, you are ready to start thinking in terms of weeks and even months.

You should start communicating your plans to your management. The best time to start communicating the plans is after you have executed at least one cycle of the plan.

Always state these long-term plans as proposals to your manager, and ask for feedback.

Every item must be either visibly completed, delayed, removed, or replaced. No items should go unaccounted for.

items show up on a plan and are never mentioned again, people will stop trusting your plans,

Your leaders want you to have independence and ownership. Making, executing, and communicating plans will help you attain both.

Failing and Copying

Larry Wall wrote that the traits of a great programmer are laziness, impatience, and hubris.

instead of looking at traits, we should look at activities that will help in improvement. If I had to pick two, I’d pick failing and copying.

Commercial failure tends to build a very direct kind of experience.

with programming, it’s not so much the experience of failing that’s valuable as the knowledge gained in working on the kind of projects that are likely to fail.

To become a better programmer,

I think you have to actively copy, widely and unashamedly.

Copying lets you go further with projects that are likely to fail.

At its best, this leads to a sort of virtuous cycle of failing and copying,

You tackle something hard, stumble up against some insurmountable problem, copy someone else’s solution, and, hey, you now know how to do whatever it was.

Thanks to Andy Hunt for this idea (http://blog.toolshed.com/2003/07/how_good_a_job_.html).

it’s stupid not to let people know what you’re capable of doing.

You have only two goals: to let people know you exist and to let them know you are the person who can solve the tough problems that keep them up at night.

## Tip 33:   Perceptions, Perschmeptions

You should care what other people think about you. Perception is reality.

There is no way to objectively measure the quality of a knowledge worker, and there is no way to objectively measure the quality of their work.

That means you are always going to be measured based on someone else’s perception of you.

We’ve culturally trained ourselves to perceive that managing perception is somehow a dirty and shameful activity. But, as you can see, managing perception is just practical.

Act on It!

Think about the different classes of relationships you generally have with people in the office.

write down which of your attributes is most likely to drive that group’s perception of you.

## Tip 34:   Adventure Tour Guide

They’re going to be looking for someone who can make them comfortable about the project they’re working on.

they are afraid of you.

Your job is to be your customer’s tour guide through the unforgiving terrain of the information technology world. You will make your customers comfortable while guiding them through an unfamiliar place.

My advice is to reverse the relationship.

working in the insurance industry, think of your customer as a subject matter expert in insurance from which you have to learn in order to get your job done.

Check yourself—Are

find examples of e-mails that you have sent to less-technical co-workers,

show the e-mails to your mom.

Hop the fence—Find

Hop the fence—Find an opportunity to be flung into a situation in which you are not the expert and are thus dependent on others who are.

## Tip 35:   Me Rite Reel Nice

i write really nice?

grammar and spelling are important.

writing skills are both necessary and are in short supply.

The ability to write creates both a superficial perception of you and a real insight into how your mind works.

Act on It!

development diary. Write a little in it each day, explaining what you’ve been working on, justifying your design decisions, and vetting tough technical or professional decisions.

## Tip 36:   Being Present

Physical proximity is an advantage in the workplace.

face-to-face communication is incredibly effective.

If you’re locked up in an office, accessible only by phone (if you answer) or e-mail and perhaps even working all hours of the night and sleeping late as a result, there’s no difference between you being onsite with your bosses and your customers and being offshore.

you need to make it personal,

Try to actually learn about the people you work with.

## Tip 37:   Suit Speak

Businesspeople

like it when their applications are fast,

But, they don’t care how many requests per second your new custom application server process can handle.

to sell a product to an audience, you have to speak to that audience in a language they can both understand and relate to.

would you be able to explain the business benefit of the tasks you are doing or the tasks you had recently done?

Act on It!

Make a list of your recent accomplishments. Write the business benefit for each.

ask a manager or trusted acquaintance how they would frame the benefit.

Make your elevator speech, and memorize it.

## Tip 38:   Change the World

if you want to be a software developer in a high-cost country, you need to come to work with a mission.

You need to effect visible change through your team, organization, or company.

You can’t stand back and watch the people in your company do things wrong. You know things could be better, and you have to change them.

Act on It!

Think of the most driven and effective people in the places where you’ve worked. What were their missions?

## Tip 39:   Let Your Voice Be Heard

Set your sights higher. Don’t think of yourself as a programmer at a specific company—after all, it’s not likely that you’ll be at the same place forever—but as a participating member of an industry.

saw a lot of overlap between the way you have to get your name out in music and in the computer industry.

The best saxophonist doesn’t always get the gig.

Who you’ve played with is at least as important as how well you play;

the better musicians are overlooked for work because everyone assumes they won’t be available

If your social/music network terminates before reaching someone, it’s not likely you’ll ever be asked to perform with that person until an intermediary connection is made.

What better ways than publishing and public speaking are there for your name to be propagated and your voice to be heard?

The weblog is a training ground.

Practice the craft of writing. Your skill will increase, and your confidence will grow.

Now that you’re writing in your own forum, you might as well take your writing to community websites, magazines, or even books.

More writing leads to more writing opportunities. And all of these lead to the opportunity to speak at conferences. Just as we started easily with the

## Tip 40:   Build Your Brand

What you want is both recognition and respect. Your name is your brand.

remember that the things you choose to do and associate yourself with have a lasting impact on what your name means to people.

Act on It!

Google yourself—Search

## Tip 41:   Release Your Code

You don’t have to work for the Big Guys to develop popular, name-brand software anymore. Now there’s another outlet: open source.

They are building a name for themselves. They are building a reputation in the industry. They may not be doing it on purpose, but they are marketing themselves in the process.

Open source contributions demonstrate skill.

Leading an open source project can demonstrate much more than technical ability.

Leading an open source project can demonstrate much more than technical ability. It takes skills in leadership, release management, documentation, and product and community support to foster a community around your efforts. And, if you do these things successfully—in your spare time as a hobby—you’ll be amazingly different from most of the other people competing for the same

Act on It!

Take a piece of open source software with unit tests. Run the unit tests through a code coverage analyzer. Find the least-tested part of the system and write tests to improve the coverage of that code.

## Tip 42:   Remarkability

Traditional marketing curricula refer to the four p’s of marketing: product, price, promotion, and placement. The idea is that if you cover all four of these categories, you’ll have

what is the goal of marketing? Its purpose is to create a connection between producers and consumers of a product or service.

Viral marketing happens when an idea is remarkable enough that consumers spread it from one person to the next.

Remarkable definitely doesn’t mean the same thing as good.

To be remarkable means that something is worthy of attention.

remarkability means that people talk about you before they are asked.

You will not become a remarkable software developer by simply being better than all

remarkability means that people talk about you before they are asked.

Act on It!

Start small, but try to do something remarkable on your current project or job.

See whether people “remark.” If not, why not? If so, in what ways?

## Tip 43:   Making the Hang

the really good people won’t mind if you want to know them. People like to be appreciated, and they like to talk about the topics they are passionate about. The fact that they are the professional or the guru or the leader or the renowned author doesn’t change that they’re human and like to interact with other humans.

the most serious barrier between us mortals and the people we admire is our own fear.

you don’t want to just randomly start babbling at these people. You’ll obviously want to seek out the ones with which you have something in common.

you can make the hang online as well as in person.

software developers have the advantage of being able to easily reach each other no matter where we may be.

Act on It!

Pick one of your favorite pieces of software and e-mail its creator.

Look for a situation where you can see the person (a users’ group meeting or speech are good possibilities), and go out of your way to start a conversation,

Can't We Just....

“Can’t we just....” The operative word in the phrase is actually we. This word implies that the business is reaching out to IT as a critical part of their team.

# Part 5 Maintaining Your Edge

The process in this book is a loop that repeats until you retire. Research, invest, execute, market, repeat. Spending too much time inside any iteration of the loop puts you at risk of becoming suddenly obsolete.

## Tip 44:   Already Obsolete

cuanto ma popuar es un tecnologia. mas peligro cores de convertirte en un javasaurio. pero tampoo hay que darse prisa. lo popular da trabajo 

I will say that the more mainstream your knowledge, the greater risk you have of being left in the technology stone age.

You have to start by realizing that even if you’re on the bleeding edge of today’s wave, you’re already probably behind on the next one. Timing being everything, start thinking ahead with your study.

Act on It!

Carve out weekly time to investigate the bleeding edge. Make room for at least two hours each week in order to research new technologies and to start to develop skills in them.

## Tip 45:   You’ve Already Lost Your Job

if you were hired to be a programmer, don’t think of yourself as a programmer. Think of yourself as maybe not a programmer anymore. Keep doing your job, but don’t get too comfortable.

Act on It!

you’re a programmer, try a day or two of doing your job as if you were a tester or a project manager.

## Tip 46:   Path with No Destination

One of America’s biggest problems is that it is a goal-oriented society.

You typically spend all your time doing things and little of your time actually reaching goals.

The real meat of your career is not the promotions and salary advances. It’s the time you spend working toward those advances.

What most of us fail to realize is that the path is the end.

Focusing on the ending makes you forget to make the process good. And, bad processes create bad products.

Act on It!

time tracking and expense reporting,

average day, such as time tracking and expense reporting, for example. The next time you have to do a task like this, see whether you can find a way to focus on the task as you do it instead of anxiously rushing to finish it.

The next time you have to do a task like this, see whether you can find a way to focus on the task as you do it instead of anxiously rushing to finish it.

## Tip 47:   Make Yourself a Map

Unless you’re looking to exit the industry, you need a road map.

Your personal product road map is what you use to tell whether you’ve moved.

each choice should be part of a greater whole.

this an address book or a chat application? Is it a game or a web browser? A personal product road map not only can help you stay on track, constantly evolving, but it can also show you the bigger picture of what you have to offer.

Each new investment is part of a larger whole.

Act on It!

map out where you’ve been.

Show where you started and what your skills and jobs were at each step.

Once you’ve created this historical map, keep it updated. It’s a great way to reflect on your progress as you move toward your newly defined goals.

## Tip 48:   Watch the Market

As the conditions of the market change, not paying attention could result in money lost or money that could have been earned missed.

The same holds true for your knowledge investments.

Watch the technology news, both the business side and the purely technical side,

watch the alpha geeks. Alpha geeks are those super-nerds who are always on the bloodiest tip of the bleeding edge,

Act on It!

Spend the next year trying to become one of the alpha geeks. Or at least make the hang with one.

## Tip 49:   That Fat Man in the Mirror

If you’re constantly exposed to something, it’s hard to see it changing unless change happens rapidly.

You’ll notice the same phenomenon with your career. Actually, you won’t notice it. That’s the problem. You might look at yourself in the metaphorical mirror each day and not see an ounce of change.

Then, suddenly, one day your job (or your industry) doesn’t fit you anymore.

An easy way to measure your progress is to use a trusted third party.

A mentor or a close colleague doesn’t live in your head with you and can help give you a more objective look at where you stand.

The most important thing to ferret out as you go through a process like this (either alone or with help) is where your blind spots are.

Act on It!

Do a 360 review:

Make a list of trusted people who you feel comfortable asking for feedback.

Make another list of about ten characteristics you believe are important measurements of you as a professional.

Convert this list to a questionnaire.

What you need is honest feedback—not

Share the outcome of your questionnaire with your reviewers—not the answers but the resultant changes you plan to make.

Start keeping a journal.

Write about what you’re working

## Tip 50:   The South Indian Monkey Trap

como los monos valoran la comida asra el punto de morir por un puñao

Value rigidity is what happens when you believe in the value of something so strongly that you can no longer objectively question it.

But not all rigidly held values are good ones. Also, many times something that is good in one set of circumstances is not good in another.

it’s easy to get hung up on technology choices.

We love the technology so much and place such a high value on defending it

Act on It!

Find your monkey traps—What are your rigid assumptions?

Make a table with two columns, “Career” and “Technology.”

Under each heading list the values that you hold unfalteringly true.

go one at a time through the list and mentally reverse each statement.

Know your enemy—Pick the technology you hate most, and do a project in

## Tip 51:   Avoid Waterfall Career Planning

Early in my own conversion to agile methodologies (specifically Extreme Programming), I started to see everything through the lens of agile development.

I had designed my career up front like a software waterfall project.

What I was doing to myself was the same thing heavy processes did to their customers. I was doing an excellent job at delivering a career to myself that I didn’t want.

It was unintuitive to me at first, but the solution to such a problem is to simply change your career.

The important thing to realize is that change is not only possible in your career but necessary.

Set big goals, but make constant corrections along the way. Learn from the experience, and change the goals as you go.

## Tip 52:   Better Than Yesterday

Most important challenges in life manifest themselves as large, insurmountable amorphous blobs of potential failure.

Because of this complexity, we easily become demotivated by the bigger issues and turn our attention instead to things that are easier to measure and easier to quickly fix.

es como cuando haces diea. por muy esrricto que seas. no vas a ver resultados inmediatamente 

But even when I’m getting with the program in a serious way, it’s hard to see the results.

The secret is to focus on making whatever it is you’re trying to improve better today than it was yesterday.

You might not be able to see a noticeable difference in the whole with each incremental change, though.

for most of the big, difficult goals you’re striving for, it’s important to think not about getting closer each day to the goal as it is to think about doing better in your efforts toward that goal than yesterday.

So, make your improvements small and incremental but daily. Small improvements also decrease the cost of failure.

Act on It!

Make a list of the difficult or complex improvements you’d like to make;

for each item in the list, think about what you could do today to make yourself or that item better than yesterday.

## Tip 53:   Go Independent

in a big company a smart person could get by with hardly getting anything done.

If you can hide behind the shield of mediocrity that most corporate divisions wield, there’s not much incentive to excel.

But if you’re striving to be remarkable (which you are!), a big company is a hard place to find the right groove

Go independent!

Going independent is hard. It puts all your skills as a professional to the test. You might not be ready for it yet.

Consider it a personal development project, and put yourself in the market in your spare time.

Work on it at night or on the weekends

Curiosity Is a Strength

believe curiosity can be a strength.

Whenever I get comfortable, I know it’s time to try something new.

decide what you do for a living is a great privilege which very few people enjoy.

Software development is both challenging and rewarding. It’s creative like an art-form, but (unlike art) it provides concrete, measurable value.
