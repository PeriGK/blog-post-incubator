No he podido con el libro. No es que no fuera interesante, pero no he podido con él. Quizás ha sido el inglés. No sé, pero las historias se me hacían muy pesadas.

- todos hemis preguntado al profe. y edto psra q me sirve?
- “When am I going to use this?”
- WHEN AM I GOING TO USE THIS?
- “Mathematics is not just a sequence of computations to be carried out by rote until your patience or stamina runs out—although
- Those integrals are to mathematics as weight training and calisthenics are to soccer.
- Do professional players ever use those drills?
- But you do see players using the strength, speed, insight, and flexibility they built up by doing those drills,
- ABRAHAM WALD AND THE MISSING BULLET HOLES
- The armor, said Wald, doesn’t go where the bullet holes are. It goes where the bullet holes aren’t: on the engines.
- The reason planes were coming back with fewer hits to the engine is that planes that got hit in the engine weren’t coming back.
- A mathematician is always asking, “What assumptions are you making? And are they justified?”
- To a mathematician, the structure underlying the bullet hole problem is a phenomenon called survivorship bias.
- funds in this class grew an average of 178.4% between 1995 and 2004: a healthy 10.8% per year.
- But something’s missing: the funds that aren’t there.
- if you included the performance of the dead funds together with the surviving ones, the rate of return dropped down to 134.5%, a much more ordinary 8.9% per year.
- MATHEMATICS IS THE EXTENSION OF COMMON SENSE BY OTHER MEANS
- ONE LESS LIKE SWEDEN
- TWO STRAIGHT LOCALLY, CURVED GLOBALLY
- 
- acuerdate de como medir el area de un circulo mediante poligonos con cada vez mas lados rectos
- The slogan to keep in mind: straight locally, curved globally.
- 
- EVANESCENT INCREMENTS AND UNNECESSARY PERPLEXITIES
- THREE EVERYONE IS OBESE
- 
- linear regression,
- Every time you read in the newspaper that people with more cousins are happier,
- Here’s how it works. You have two things you want to relate; let’s say, the cost of tuition at a university and the average SAT score
- The points in the picture above are obviously not on a line. But you can see that they’re not far off.
- Linear regression takes the guesswork out, finding the line that comes closest
- Whenever you want to understand which variables drive which other variables, and in which direction, it’s the first thing you reach for. And it works on any data set at all.
- como funciona con cualquier coonjunto de dstos. de puede relacilnsr variables que no tengsn nada que ver
- That’s a weakness as well as a strength.
- ASIDE: HOW TO GET PARTIAL CREDIT ON MY CALCULUS EXAM
- 
- The methods of calculus are a lot like linear regression: they’re purely mechanical, your calculator can carry them out, and it is very dangerous to use them inattentively.
- Working an integral or performing a linear regression is something a computer can do quite effectively. Understanding whether the result makes sense—or deciding whether the method is the right one to use in the first place—requires a guiding human hand.
- BACK TO THE OBESITY APOCALYPSE
- FOUR HOW MUCH IS THAT IN DEAD
- FOUR HOW MUCH IS THAT IN DEAD AMERICANS?
- The 1,074 Israelis killed by terrorists amount to about 0.015% of the Israeli population (which between 2000 and 2005 ranged from about 6 to 7 million). So the pundits are reckoning that the death of 0.015% of the much larger United States population, which indeed comes to about 50,000, would have roughly the same impact here. This is lineocentrism in its purest form.
- cuando compara las muertes de atocha con lo que huburra pasado en eeuu. o nueva yirk. o otra ciudsd. csda uno da un resultado muy disrinto
- Eventually (or perhaps immediately?) this reasoning starts to break down.
- 
- Law of Large Numbers.
- the more coins you flip, the more and more extravagantly unlikely it is that you’ll get 80% heads.
- cuantas mas monedas tires al aire . mas se acercaran las probabilidsdes al 50/50
- the more coins you flip, the more and more extravagantly unlikely it is that you’ll get 80% heads.
- THE GENDARME’S HAT
- 
- The smaller the number of coins—what we’d call in statistics the sample size—the greater the variation in the proportion of heads.
- It’s the very same effect that makes political polls less reliable when fewer voters are polled.
- Moivre’s insight is that the size of the typical discrepancy* is governed by the square root of the number of coins you toss. Toss a hundred times as many coins as before and the typical discrepancy grows by a factor of 10—at least, in absolute terms. As a proportion of the total number of tosses, the discrepancy shrinks as the number of coins grows,
- De Moivre
- De Moivre wasn’t satisfied with the Law of Large Numbers,
- He wanted to know how much closer.
- Moivre’s insight is that the size of the typical discrepancy* is governed by the square root of the number of coins you toss. Toss a hundred times as many coins as before and the typical discrepancy grows by a factor of 10—at least, in absolute terms. As a proportion of the total number of tosses, the discrepancy shrinks as the number of coins grows,
- If you want to make the error bar half as big, you need to survey four times as many people.
- a partially ordered set. That’s a fancy way of saying that some pairs of disasters can be meaningfully compared, and others cannot.
- FIVE MORE PIE THAN PLATE
- Don’t talk about percentages of numbers when the numbers might be negative.
- por ejemplo. creacion de empleo.puedes de cir que si el paro baka 100 personas y en tu ciudad crea 80 empleos. parce qu lo ha creado la misma ciudad. pero no es asi porque puede qu otra hayan perdio 10000 empleos

- SIX THE BALTIMORE STOCKBROKER AND THE BIBLE CODE
- THE BALTIMORE STOCKBROKER
- you receive an unsolicited newsletter from a stockbroker in Baltimore, containing a tip that a certain stock is due for a big rise.
- A week passes, and just as the Baltimore stockbroker predicted, the stock goes up.
- And so on.
- you’ve been swayed by the impressive results, but you don’t know how many chances the broker had to get those results.
