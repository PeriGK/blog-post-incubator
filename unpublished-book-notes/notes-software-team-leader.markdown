## Por qué lo he leído

Ya tengo unos años de experiencia en esto de desarrollar software. No me veo
capaz todavía de liderar un gran equipo de desarrollo, pero me siento más
inclinado hacia un liderazgo técnico que un liderazgo *de gestión*. Así que,
¿por qué no aprender un poco sobre un rol que tengo ganas de hacer? 

<!-- more -->

## Qué esperaba

El nombre del autor me sonaba de algo, no sé exactamente de qué, pero no recuerdo
haber leído algún otro libro suyo. Pero me sonaba que era un autor muy práctico,
con muchísima experiencia en la industria del software, por lo que esperaba un
libro de lleno de vivencias y experiencias. Quizá una historia que guiara al lector
por el camino de crear un equipo autoorganizado (que está tan de moda ahora con
las metodologías ágiles).

## Qué encontré

Encontré una descripción de las fases en las que se puede encontrar un equipo de
desarrollo, bueno, la visión del autor, pero algo es algo. El libro también está
lleno de ejemplos y consejos sobre cómo mejorar el equipo, cómo hacer que
miembros de un equipo mejoren en su carrera profesional.

También, una sección del libro está dedicada a *testimonios* de absolutos expertos
en la materia. Estos últimos capítulos están llenos de experiencias reales y de
consejos de gente brillante y con una ingente cantidad de experiencia en el
desarrollo de software.

## Conclusiones

El libro consta de varias partes. Comienza describiendo las fases en las que se
puede encontrar un equipo de desarrollo, y cómo avanzar de una a otra, hasta
conseguir el equipo perfecto.

Es un libro muy *buen-rollista*, tanto que a veces da la impresión de ser un
libro de autoayuda. Pero el libro está lleno de consejos super útiles. Quizá
se echa de menos la parte contraria, por ningún lado se encuentra cómo arreglar
problemas dentro del equipo. Supongo que no era el objetivo del libro.

La última sección del libro, la dedicada a los testimonios, tiene muchísimo
valor. Los mejores de los mejores ponen su granito de arena en el libro y
dedican unos consejos al lector que de otra forma sería imposible recopilar.

Si lo que te interesa es el aspecto técnico del desarrollo, éste puede ser un
libro para ti. Puedes leer mis notas en
[Notas sobre Notes to a software team leader][1].

## Qué he aprendido

- Usar la autoridad debe ser el último recurso. Ayudar a cada uno a encontrar
su camino ayuda a que ambas partes ganen.
- Comunicación y traducción de información son habilidades críticas de un líder.
- Necesitas discutir, influenciar, negociar y no decirle a la gente lo que debe
hacer.
- Dar feedback es una técnica muy efectiva, pero debe ser de confianza, concreto,
constructivo, e incluir contexto.
- Un líder técnico debería programar, aunque no mucho, pero sobre todo debería
practicar pair programming, design y code reviews y también debería buscar que
no se genere demasiada deuda técnica.

## Frases que me gustaría recordar

- El autor identifica tres formas de liderar un equipo: comando y control, coach
y facilitador. Simétricamente, identifica tres fases en las que se puede
encontrar un equipo: supervivencia, aprendizaje, auto-organización.
- Para salir de la fase de supervivencia, hay que preocuparse de una cosa: crear
tiempo libre (*slack time*) como un estándar en tu flujo de trabajo.
- Esto es por lo que te pagan: para hacer las cosas mejor y de la forma más
profesional, clara y transparente posible. Te pagan por llevar al equipo a un
nivel donde hacen las cosas profesionalmente, para llevar al equipo al próximo
nivel de rendimiento y profesionalismo. Para ello, quizá tengas que tomar
algunos riesgos.
- Para salir del modo de supervivencia, debes pasar al menos el 50% del tiempo
con ellos. Lo primero que hay que hacer es una inversión de tiempo, y el que
debe comenzar eres tú (no reuniones, quizá horas extra,...)
- El aprendizaje más rico y verdadero es cuando damos un salto en el conocimiento,
no estando seguros en la parte plana del gráfico (hace referencia a un gráfico
de aprendizaje de planicies seguidos de saltos, como escalones).
- Sumergirse en una nueva cultura de formas de trabajar es dar un salto
cualitativo de conocimiento. Jugar a lo seguro no lo es.
- Crear un *lenguaje de compromiso* es un paso esencial para que los miembros
del equipo mantengan sus promesas con los demás.
- Cuando la gente se te acerque con un problema, rétale a que lo resulva por
sí mismo, pero que sepa que te tiene a tí como mentor, pero déjale claro que
tú no vas a solucionar el problema.
- Miembros del equipo se pueden llevar deberes a casa, pero tiene que ser
voluntario, no lo deben tomar como trabajo.
- Los problemas más difíciles de resolver nunca son técnicos, suelen involucrar
a las personas.
- Un buen líder técnico mantiene siempre un ojo puesto en la calidad. Cuando el
equipo crece, las personas de más confianza cumplen parte de esta misión.
- Una buena táctica para tener un equipo feliz es animar al equipo a usar un
período de tiempo semanal para aprender nuevas habilidades o tecnologías.
- Las ideas de cambio deberían venir tanto de tí como de miembros del equipo.

## Introduction

The Team Leader Manifesto is continuously being developed and refined. You can find the latest version of it at http://5whys.com/manifesto.

Doing your job as a leader and asking people to accomplish tasks or to challenge people could indeed feel weird, but, in my experience, doing it can garner more respect for you, not less

### 2 Elastic Leadership

I believe the role of a team leader is vastly different from simply solving problems and getting out of the way. A team leader grows the people on their team. To grow people at work means to help them acquire new skills. For them to acquire skills you must challenge them.

Challenging people is one style of leadership. Let’s talk about two more: Command and control leadership Facilitating leadership

Facilitation, can be described by many agile consultants as “Just lock the team in a room, give them a goal, and get the hell out of their way.” Agile methodologies sometimes call this a “self-organizing” team.

**Command and control**: You tell people what to do. This approach won’t work if your team already knows what they’re doing or if they expect to learn new things and be challenged to become better.

**Coach**: The coach is also known as “the teacher” and is great at teaching new things to others.

**Facilitator**: The facilitator doesn’t solve the team’s problems but instead relies on the team’s existing skills to solve their own problems.

2.6 The three team phases

**Survival phase** (no time to learn). You need to make time to learn. In order to slack time, you will most likely need to use a command and control style of leadership.

**Learning phase** (learning to solve your own problems). Grow the team to be self-organizing by teaching and challenging them to solve their own problems. You need to become more of a coaching style leader, with the occasional intervention of the controlling leader,

**Self-organizing phase**. Facilitate, experiment.

2.7 When does a team move between phases?

Let’s say you are bringing into the team new people. You might be going into the learning phase. You might take the opportunity to teach some of the more experienced folks on the team how to mentor the new team members

Let’s say you or someone else is changing deadlines on known goals. You might be in the survival phase.

## The Survival Phase

### 3 Survival mode

It is what I define as “not having enough time to learn.”

3.1 Are you in survival mode?

The comfortable zone

En el modo de supervivencia, uno tiene sentimientos de superpoderes. Las cosas se ponen feas, va uno y las resuelve. Y en lugar de sentirse mal por los problemas, se siente bien por haberlo solucionado. Ahí está el problema, es como una adicción a estar siempre apagando fuegos. Uno se siente mejor solucionando problemas sin pensar que en parar un tiempo para solucionarlos para siempre.

3.2 Getting out of survival mode

To get out of survival mode, you have to worry about one thing: creating slack time as a standard in your work process.

3.3 Making slack time

You can start by understanding the mess you’re currently in.

Find out your current commitments. Making slack time is about getting rid of some of the commitments you already have.

Find out your current risks: “Imagine it is six months from now, and our project has failed completely. Why did it fail?”

Now that you know your current commitments as a team, it’s time to plan a red line. Once you have a red line, you have a deadline. Your job is to clear enough fires before the red line so that when you hit the red line, you feel comfortable having learning time. Past the line, your schedule will include tasks, but fewer than usual.

3.4 Why slack?

Remember why you’re doing this. You can become the team leader you wish you always were: someone who fights for the team’s right to learn and to always improve.

That’s what you get paid to do: make things better, in the most professional, clear, and transparent way. This is what you are being paid to do. You are being paid to get your team to a level where they do things professionally. You are being paid to keep taking the team to the next level of performance and professionalism,

Realize that you are going to break your own patterns. The same applies to what you’re about to do as a team leader. You’re about to take a risk, do something you’ve never done before, and change circumstances that seem almost unchangeable. Eventually, you realize that in life you always have to get uncomfortable before you learn new skills, and that this is just a phase of learning. Es como aprender a jugar. Aprendes una nueva regla que te da mas puntos. Cambia tu forma de jugar. Hasta que te acostumbras a esta nueva regla, te cuesta más y juegas peor. Pero luego eres mucho mejor.

As you break your and your team’s patterns, you might get into some arguments with the folks who don’t like change or don’t trust you. Be prepared for this to happen. Don’t stay where you’re not appreciated and where you cannot change things. Don’t despair in the face of nitpickers (criticón, sacafaltas).

3.5 Command and control leadership

When the ship is sinking, the captain doesn’t call a meeting. The captain gives orders. Correct bad decisions.

So if your team decides for some reason not to use source control, you step in and make a choice. There’s simply no time to start debating such a decision. Now is the time to get out of survival mode.

Now also is the time to get every team member to do what they do best, not to challenge them

3.6 During transformation you will likely need to...

Once you have a green light from management to add slack time and to begin growing out of survival mode, you might need to make several changes to the way you manage yourself and your team. You need to start spending more time with the team.

At least 50 percent of your time should be spent either in the team room or talking or working with one of the developers. To clear up 50 percent of your time, you will need to remove yourself from meetings. There has to be a time investment first. And it has to be you because you are the one who leads the team.

You need to take ownership of your team: handling multiple stakeholder requests at the same time is one of the causes of survival mode. Stakeholder conversations should take place through you.

Learn how to say no by saying yes: If your stakeholder wants feature X, bring them up to the wall and say “OK, which feature do you want to move down in order to build this?”

Need to start doing daily stand-up meetings

Need to understand the notion of broken windows

Need to start doing serious code reviews. Code reviews are a great tool for teaching and learning, but during survival they can be used to mitigate a code-quality problem. Effective code reviews are not done via a tool or remotely—they are done when you’re sitting side-by-side.

## The Learning Phase

### 4 Learning to learn

In this image, you can see that there are two types of *progress*: There are plateaus where the learning progress is slow and steady. There are peaks in which there is a lot of quick learning. What happened at those peaks of learning? Those were the places where he discovered something new about how to play the game. Something that changed the game for him. Notice how just before every peak, there is a ravine? (surco, agujero, escarbado, pozo)

Our truest, richest learning comes from jumping into ravines, not by staying safely on a plateau.

4.1 Embrace ravines

I think the true power of learning is to realize this simple fact: ravines eventually end and you are left with new knowledge.

How can you tell it’s a ravine? You’re scared. It will change you. It will teach you new skills.

For example, learning a new framework built into your favorite programming platform is not a ravine. but if it is a ravine, it’s a very small one. It is part of a developer’s job. Leearning a new language on your home machine late at night after work, you’re not really jumping into a ravine.

The real scary part in the IOC framework suggestion is holding other people back, so it might be that the ravine one person might encounter is working with other people or talking with other people. Implementing an IOC framework might be the trigger for the real thing—communicating with others. But IOC is not the point.

4.2 Challenge your team into ravines

Giving people on your team homework is a great way to teach new skills. It’s important that this homework be a ravine-like task. You can only ask someone to jump into a ravine with open eyes after you’ve done this yourself at least once. You can inspire others to do jump into ravines only when you have your own story to share about some deep learning you’ve done and how it scared you.

### 5 Commitment Language

Creating a *language of commitment* is one of the first steps to having team members who keep their promises to each other.

What does non-commitment sound like?: “We should take care of that.” Look for usage of words that leave room to not accomplish something. The problem is that instead of telling someone, “I can’t commit to that,” we end up telling them what they want to hear. We also don’t like confrontation. Telling someone what they don’t want to hear is a form of confrontation

Commitment sounds like someone stating a fact about them doing a specific thing, by a specific time or date. **I will [perform a certain action] by [a certain date]**

For commitment language to work, for integrity to exist, you have to insist that people commit only to things under their own control.

Turn an impossible commitment into a possible one. Trick is to notice someone is committing to something outside their control and then ask them to commit to one or more steps that can lead to this desired goal.

So how do you get them on board? Launch a commitment language initiative at a team meeting. Explain that from that moment on, you’ll be asking people to use concrete commitment language when promising to do something. See how using this new language affects how people make promises. Fix just-in-time errors (no dejes pasar ni una)

What if they fail to meet their commitments? The basic idea is that they raise a red flag as quickly as possible.

When someone has made a commitment to you, and it is not clear, it is very useful to repeat what you think that person has committed to.

Can commitments drag on forever? It is easy to explain that some tasks cannot be proven to end by a specific time. Look for **by**, not **at**. The difference is that you are not breaking your commitment if you still do that something, but it is earlier than when you promised.

### 6 Growing People

Sooner or later a team member will come to you with a “wishful problem”. Ask the person who said this one simple question: “What are you going to do about it?”. As the person answers you, challenge them to use commitment language.

When to use problem challenging? As people come to you with a problem, challenge them to solve it on their own, with you as their mentor but without you doing the work for them. Help them figure the problem out and don’t solve it for them. Teach them to solve the problem on their own.

Do not punish for lack of trying or lack of success. When people are challenged to solve their own problems, it is important not to punish people who did not solve them. It is their problem, so they will continue to suffer for it.

**Homework** is things that a team member could do better or things they need to do better because they hurt the team. Areas of growth during homework are: something they feel will inspire them, something that will get them out of their comfort zone (you can tell if they are afraid of doing it), something that needs to change because it hurts the team.

Things that don’t fit in: learning the latest buzzword technology on the same platform, learning a new platform without learning its culture, homework is about learning a new skill, not a new technology.

Homework is a personal commitment, not a task. If someone takes on homework, they should treat it as a personal growth challenge, not as a work task. The desire to get better and break your own limits is what drives this homework.

Homework has follow-up: si no se puede hacer un seguimiento semanal del progreso no es *homework*.

Make sure to challenge people on no more than a couple of fronts at the same time.

Sometimes you’ll see people going down the wrong path on a problem and you’ll have to make the decision whether you should let them follow that path and learn for themselves why it’s wrong or keep them away from it completely. That depends on how much time you can spare.

I try to always leave people whom I’ve led better off than they were, in terms of new skills and challenges. You’ll find that people will want to work more with you and will remember you even years later, no matter how short the time spent with them was.

## IV The Self-Organization Phase

### 7 Use clearing meetings to advance self-organization

Clearing meetings can have several goals: introduce important issues everyone should know about, a stop-the-line trigger that makes everyone pay attention to an important issue, air issues that bother them, gauge the current level of the team’s self-organization, create more trust within the team, remind them to solve problems on their own (la verdad es que es bastante parecido a una retrospectiva)

Clearing Meeting

- Jim, is there anything that you would have liked to have gone better this week? Something you’re not happy about that happened?”
- “OK. What are you going to do about it?”
- I think that is what eventually stopped us from releasing.”
- “I will fix the build by this evening.”
- please commit to something fully under your control.
- “Jim, if you fix the build, you’re doing that thing again.
- we don’t have time for teaching everyone on my team about the build process.”
- “Really? Everything was just perfect? This week couldn’t have gone better at work?”
- Jim, tell us about something good that happened for you this week or something good that was done by someone you work with.”
- “OK. What’s not working for me? Well, nothing. Whatever wasn’t working, you’re already doing something about that.
- Thanks. Jenna,
- Thank you. David,

I started the integrity meeting by asking these three simple questions:

1. “Is there anything that hurts the team and needs correcting?”: Avoiding blind acceptance of the status quo is one of the things you want your team to learn. If an argument starts, try to keep it going. Embrace conflict.
2. “What are you going to do about it?” Do not blindly accept that which bothers you. There is always something you can do. This is the core of self-organization: when the team finds something that needs to change, they look within to begin solving the problem, instead of forwarding the problem to a manager.
3. “What has been working for you the past week?” There should always be something good to say. Don’t let people not say anything. Your closing words

Now that everyone has said what didn’t work and what did work for them this week, it’s your turn. Remind the team that, as an exercise, you want them to try to reach the next meeting not only with things that didn’t work for them but also with actions they’ve already taken.

The overall point of this meeting: it is very effective at teaching a team of peers to think proactively about solving things that bother them

### 8 Influence Patterns

The frustration I have felt, and that you might be feeling, is about helplessness. You believe in doing the right things, but you just can’t seem to get the people around you to change their behavior.

Using your authority is usually the path you should take last. Helping them find their own path that makes everyone win is a much more effective way to teach new skills.

Remember, it is your job to do all the hard stuff, and that includes gently confronting people and talking with them about serious issues.

Force Description Personal ability Does the person have all the skills or knowledge to perform what is required? Personal motivation Does the person take satisfaction from the right behavior or dislike the wrong behavior? Do they have the self-control to engage in the behavior when it’s hardest to do so? Social ability Do you or others provide the help, information, and resources required to that person, particularly at critical times? Social motivation Are the people around them actively encouraging the right behavior .. ..or discouraging the wrong behavior? Are you or others modeling the right behavior in an effective way? Environmental ability Are there aspects in the environment (building, budget, and so on).. ..that make the behavior convenient, easy, and safe? Are there enough cues and reminders to the stay on course? Environmental motivation Are there clear and meaningful rewards (such as with pay, bonuses, or incentives).. ..when you or others behave the right or wrong way? Do short-term rewards match the desired long-term results.. ..and behaviors you want or want to avoid?

## V Notes to a software team leader

### 9 Feeding Back by Kevlin Henney

For software engineers, offering and taking feedback, positive or negative, can be just as much a minefield. When there is a problem, it is too easy to resort to silence or complaint. When there is not a problem, it is too easy to resort to silence. Part of team leadership involves leading by example, but part involves guidance.

Feedback is a guidance technique. To be effective, feedback also needs to be trusted, concrete, and constructive. If the only feedback you offer is negative and corrective, it is likely to dampen anyone’s spirits. Feedback should also be contextual and concrete. Be specific.

Especifica qué es bueno o qué es malo. Si no, no habrá aprendizaje.

### 10 Channel conflict into learning by Dan North

Conflict is a necessary ingredient of learning teams. As a software team leader, it will fall to you to make the big decisions. When the team senses change on the horizon, you will find strong advocates for different alternatives, which can paralyse the team. When I find a team blocked on a decision, I will often suggest deferring the commitment by trying all the options simultaneously and letting the data inform the decision.

Regardless of which you choose you haven’t lost any time. You are trading off efficiency for effectiveness: it’s more expensive to get there, but you get there faster and you know you made a better decision.

### 11 It’s Probably Not a Technical Problem by Bill Walters

The most difficult problems are not technical problems.

### 12 Review the Code by Robert C. Martin

One of the biggest mistakes that new software team leaders make is to consider the code written by the programmers as the private property of the author, as opposed to an asset owned by the team. Team leaders with this dysfunction will accept any code so long as it does what it is supposed to do, regardless of how it is written. This is how you lose control over the quality of your system. A good team leader takes responsibility for the code structure as well as its behavior. A good team leader acts as a quality inspector, looking at every line of code. A good team leader maintains a vision of code quality.

As teams grow, good team leaders will recruit lieutenants to help them with this review and enforcement task.

### 13 Document Your Air, Food, and Water by Travis Illig

Think about all of the things you need to know when you are new to a team. Many times, the answers to these questions are not actually documented anywhere. It is “tribal knowledge”. It’s a good idea to document your air, food, and water in a central location that’s accessible to everyone. Keep sort of a “team FAQ”.

### 14 Appraisals and Agile Don’t Play Nicely by Gary Reynolds

One thing that they all have in common is that they focus on the individual, their performance. They encourage the individual to take credit for themselves and to compete against the other people on their team. The annual review is replaced or supplemented with a system of continuous feedback and learning where individuals—in line with agile—are empowered to self-organize their own career development.

### 15 Leading Through Learning: The Responsibilities of a Team Leader by Cory Foy

The core of the movement is that developers need to be taking responsibility for their own careers–learning, teaching, mentoring, speaking. In it, there was one key question that is perhaps the hardest question for many leads: Will my developers be better in a month or two than they were before? If not, how do I make that happen?

Motivating not by fear or by money, but by passion that the team is always greater than any one developer can be.

### 16 The Core Protocols Introduction by Yves Hanoulle

The Core Protocols which are available for download at http://alturl.com/b9fn. I find that the Check-In Protocol offers a powerful way to show emotions in a mature way, both at work and in my personal life.

### 17 Change your mind: your product is your team by Jose Ramón Diaz

The product will be as good as your team is. Start changing your focus. From product to team. From technology to people.

### 19 Spread your workload - John Hill

In many team environments, there will be members who are less likely to willingly accept tasks that they do not enjoy - the “complainers” (i.e. they kick up a stink) and those who just get their heads down and complete any task that you give them - the “reliables”. Team leaders, including myself in my early years, naturally give the less fun jobs to the “reliables”. The solution involves sharing the load equally.

### 20 Making your team manage their own work by Lior Friedman

The game of picking who does what, is not worth playing. It is better to avoid the problem. Let the team decide on its own who does what.

### 21 Go see, ask why, show respect by Horia Slushanschi

How can you best show respect? You do so by challenging their thinking about the current work process, asking lots of open, probing questions to uncover the root causes of the current impediments. Team members can’t quite do it all alone because they are often too close to the issue to fully appreciate its full context.

### 22 Keep Developers Happy, Reap High-Quality Work by Derek Slawson

One of the most important lessons I’ve learned is that you must keep your developers happy and motivated. First and foremost, you need an agreed-upon team coding standard. Another beneficial tactic to keep the team happy is to encourage the team to use a set time during the workweek to learn new skills or technologies. One last motivational technique is another one that can make management cringe: you absolutely need to establish that you prioritize quality over quantity.

### 23 Stop Doing Their Work by Brian Dishaw

Chances are you got put into a leadership position because you were good at your previous job. Continuing this behavior as the leader, however, is a dereliction of your current responsibilities. In other words, this means you aren’t focusing on learning and growing in your current position. what they were saying was not “Brian is never around‚” or “Brian is always in meetings.” It was “Brian doesn’t trust us so I need to make sure I get his sign-off before I continue.” I did that to them not because I didn’t trust them or that I didn’t want them to be successful. It was because I took their growth opportunities from them.

### 24 Write code, but not too much by Patrick Kua

One of the most difficult activities is balancing time spent writing code versus other leadership activities. Writing no code leads to a lack of specific context.  Writing too much code probably means other important leadership activities are being neglected. To code is easiest in teams practicing pair programming. Great team leaders delegate tasks early, combining frequent design or code reviews to ensure overall standards are met. Other coding activities team leaders should strive for are looking for critical technical debt.

### 25 Evolving from Manager to Leader by Tricia Broderick

Your evolution from a manager to a leader will be a primarily based on a combination of two assets. The first one is your ability to adapt and handle any risk or issue, the second one is your passion and skill for coaching and mentoring. “I should just fix that myself” will not scale. However, you have only adjusted the response to, “What did not I teach them to avoid this problem?”,

### 26 Affecting the pace of change by Tom Howlett

Learn the techniques to help and encourage others to adopt change whilst remaining a happy and effective team. Ideas for change should be coming from within the team as well as from you. Your team will hopefully contain different personality types. This will always cause tension. In the early days, the tension will create anxiety and frustration, but as you get better at collaborating, this tension will contribute to the effectiveness

Some people are respected for being competent at their job. New ideas that challenge the way they currently work have the potential to challenge the feeling of competence leading to embarrassment. Don’t become frustrated by this;

### 27 Proximity Management by Jurgen Appelo

When you understand that distance reduces communication, you can try to optimize communication by optimizing proximity.

### 28 Babel Fish by Gil Zilberfeld

As a new team leader, communication and translation of information is the most crucial role you now have. Most people don’t even understand that others don’t speak their language.

Babel Fish. (If you don’t know, a fictitious animal, in Douglas Adams’ books, which performs instant translations). To become a successful Babel Fish, you need to learn more languages than you already know. In order to do that, you need to go out, converse and learn. To better communicate with your team, you’ll need to talk with them more.

### 30 Actions speak louder than words by Dan North

A team is more likely to follow your lead in terms of your behaviour than they are to follow your instructions.

### 31 Creating Team Trust by Johanna Rothman

Prerequisites to trust: deliver what you promise to deliver, be consistent in your actions and reactions, make integrity a cornerstone of your work, be willing to discuss, influence, and negotiate, trust in yourself and your colleagues. You need to discuss, influence, negotiate, and not tell people what to do.
