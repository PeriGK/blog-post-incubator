When you want to hurry something, that means you no longer care about it and want to get on to other things. I just want to get at it slowly, but carefully and thoroughly, with the same attitude I remember was present just before I found that sheared pin. It was that attitude that found it, nothing else.

Each machine has its own, unique personality which probably could be defined as the intuitive sum total of everything you know and feel about it.

and it is this personality that is the real object of motorcycle maintenance.

He isn't so interested in what things mean as in what they are. That's quite important, that he sees things this way. It took me a long time to see this difference and it's important for the Chautauqua that I make this difference clear.

Something is always killed. But what is less noticed in the arts'something is always created too.

This morning I talked about hierarchies of thought'the system. Now I want to talk about methods of finding one's way through these hierarchies'logic.

Two kinds of logic are used, inductive and deductive. Inductive inferences start with observations of the machine and arrive at general conclusions.

Deductive inferences do the reverse. They start with general knowledge and predict a specific observation.

The logical statements entered into the notebook are broken down into six categories: (1) statement of the problem, (2) hypotheses as to the cause of the problem, (3) experiments designed to test each hypothesis, (4) predicted results of the experiments, (5) observed results of the experiments and (6) conclusions from the results of the experiments.

the number of hypotheses to grow in recent decades seems to be nothing other than scientific method itself. The more you look, the more you see.
