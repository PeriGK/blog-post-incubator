## Por qué lo he leído

Creo recordar que vi que Miguel, de la devkitchen, lo marcaba como pendiente para leer y le di un vistazo. Por que por aquel momento seguía el blog del autor del libro, y tenía varios posts interesantes. Y el libro también me lo pareció: ¿Mejorar en tu carrera? ¿Aprender habilidades no técnica? Me gusta intercalar libros técnicos y no técnicos, y este libro parecía estar a medio camino entre ambos. Parecía una buena elección, así que decidí leerlo.

<!-- more -->

## Qué esperaba

Esperaba consejos e historias relacionadas con el software, pero ninguna historia técnica: cómo relacionarte con tus compañeros, cómo resolver conflictos, cómo negociar con tu jefe. Esperaba más temas relacionados con la relación de las persona que otra cosa. Bueno, y también un poco de productividad. Quién sabe.

## Qué encontre

Encontré todo eso y más, mucho más. El libro trata temas tan dispares que hay veces que no sabes qué tipo de libro estas leyendo. Hay tantos consejos, y de temáticas tan variadas, que es imposible no encontrar algún consejo o idea nuevos.

El libro está dividido en secciones, englobando alguna temática general: carrera profesional, marca personal, aprendizaje, producividad, economía, salud, espíritualidad. Cada sección está formada por una serie de capítulos, y cada capítulo contiene varios *artículos*. La verdad es casi como leer su blog, pero un post detrás de otro y organizados por temáticas.

## Conclusiones

El libro es tan variado que cualquier persona encontraría algún consejo valioso. John Sonmez se gana la vida de esta forma, aconsejando a programadores acerca de cómo mejorar en su carrera. En este libro encontrarás consejos de lo más variopintos: desde cómo aprender, a cómo invertir en el negocio inmoviliario, pasando por practicar deporte. Incluso hay consejos espirituales. En ese punto el libro me dejó un poco de piedra, creo que ahí se pasó, y el libro pierde un poco su identidad.

Destacaría las primeras secciones: cuando habla de la carrera profesional y el aprendizaje. También me gustó el apartado dedicado a temas financieros, siempre es intersante conocer cómo funciona el dinero.

El que menos me gustó fue el espiritual, lleno de buenrollismo y autoayuda. No sé, no le cogí el punto.

En general, me parece un libro bastante recomendable.

## Qué he aprendido

## Frases que me gustaría recordar

- Sit down and write out at least one major goal for your career. Break down that major goal into smaller goals that correspond to Months Weeks Days Write down your major goal where you can see it each day to remind you of what you’re striving for.
- If you want to be a good software developer, you have to learn to deal effectively with people (even if writing code is the part of your job you enjoy the most).
- hackeando la entrevista: la idea es consrguir una entrevista a traves de alguien de dentro .como? estableciendo una relacion perdonal con alguien de dentro .lee blogs de emplesdos... piensa difrrente y encuentra firmas de acercarte a rllos
- When a company’s focus isn’t software, typically software developers aren’t given as much respect and leeway. Companies whose livelihood is based on developing software are much more likely to put a high value on the software developers they hire.
- between more money and more responsibility. The right choice—at least in the long term—is almost always more responsibility.
- You should always be learning something new or advancing your skills in some way.

# Soft Skills: The software developer's life manual John Z. Sonmez

## Chapter 2. Getting started with a “BANG!”: Don’t do what everyone else does

Having a business mindset
because when you start to think of yourself as a business, you start to make good business decisions.
When you’re used to getting a regular paycheck that isn’t really dependent on your performance, it can be easy to develop a mindset that you’re just an employee of a company.
Tip: Just having this mindset at the start will change the way you think about your career and cause you to be mindful and present in the active management of it.
How to think like a business
llevar un negocio. tu negocio.se compone de dos partes. tu producto y marketing. el producto que endes es el serviio d crear software 
Focus on what service you’re providing and how to market that service. Think about ways you can improve your offering.
**Taking action**
If you had to describe the specific service you can provide a perspective employer or client in a single sentence, what would it be?

## Chapter 3. Thinking about the future: What are your goals?

it’s time to start defining the goals you have for this business.
yet so few software developers ever define goals for their career—why? I can only guess, but I’d say that most software developers are afraid of committing to a long-term vision for their career.
How to set goals
It’s easiest to start out with a big goal in mind and then create smaller goals along the way
Steps for setting goals
The smaller goals keep you on track and motivated so that you keep heading in the direction of your bigger goals.
puedo escribir post sobre establecer objetivos . como conseguir commit permisos a xcercism. no podia tener muchos ejercicios de ecmascript de una vez. lo tomd con calma. y uno a uno lo consegui
Tracking your goals
Periodically, you should track and update the goals you have set for yourself—and adjust them if necessary.
aconseja ponerse objetivos a espacios separados en el tiempo y revisarlos al final de ese periodo para establecer los siguientes objetivos 
The same goes for every month, quarter, and year.
**Taking action**
la verdad es q esto puede servir como resumen del capitulo
Sit down and write out at least one major goal for your career. Break down that major goal into smaller goals that correspond to Months Weeks Days Write down your major goal where you can see it each day to remind you of what you’re striving for.

## Chapter 4. People skills: You need them more than you think

Leave me alone, I just want to write code!
If you want to be a good software developer, you have to learn to deal effectively with people (even if writing code is the part of your job you enjoy the most).
Learning how to deal with people
Everyone wants to feel important
Every time you interact with another person, you should remember and be aware of how you’re affecting this basic human need.
la necesidad d la q habla es q todo el mundo quiere sentirse importante
Never criticize
en lugar de criticar y juzgar y castigar. muerdete lengua y aprende a solo alabar 
If you want to motivate and inspire, use praise instead of criticism.
Think about what the other person wants
Listen attentively and then when it’s your time to talk, phrase your dialog in ways that appeal to the desires of the other person.
Avoiding arguments
Landmine: Dealing with “poisonous” people
If you have to interact with them, do it in a minimal, nonemotionally invested way.
**Taking action**
In a single day at your work, keep track of every encounter you have with another human being. At the end of the day, count up how many interactions you had during that day, including answering emails or phone calls.

## Chapter 5. Hacking the interview

The quickest way to “pass” an interview
the quickest way to pass an interview is to get the interviewer to like you. There are many ways to go about doing this, most of which can be done before the interview even starts.
How I got my last job
rapport signiica una relacion donde las dos psrtes se entiende a la perfección 
Thinking outside of the box and building rapport
la idea es consrguir una entrevista a traves de alguien de dentro .como? estableciendo una relacion perdonal con alguien de dentro .lee blogs de emplesdos... piensa difrrente y encuentra firmas de acercarte a rllos

But what about the actual interview itself?
control—focus on demonstrating why you’re the kind of employee who gets things done without being asked to do them.
What can you do right now?
start developing your network before you need it. Start reaching out to employees at different companies
And don’t forget to practice. You might want to interview for jobs just to get practice doing interviews—even
**Taking action**

## Chapter 6. Employment options: Enumerate your choices

Option 1: The employee
Option 2: The independent consultant
quiza este bien hacer una comparativs con las tablss q john vaya poniendo 
Table 6.1. Benefits and drawbacks of being an employee
Option 3: The entrepreneur
Which should you pick?

## Chapter 7. What kind of software developer are you?

specialization is important.
Specialization is important
Getting specific about specialties
The rule of specialization is that the deeper you specialize, the fewer potential opportunities you’ll have,
Kinds of specialties for software developers
Picking your specialty
Specialization Areas Web development stack Embedded systems Specific operating system Mobile development Framework Software system
And don’t worry; you can always change your specialty later if you need to.
What about the Polyglot programmer?
Learn as much as you can and become as flexible as possible, but also have a specialty that makes you unique and stand out.
**Taking action**
List all the different kinds of software developer specialties you can think of. Go from broad to specific and see how specific you can get.

## Chapter 8. Not all companies are equal

It’s important to decide for yourself whether you want to work for a small company just starting up, a large corporation with massive budgets and shareholders, or somewhere in between.
Small companies and startups
Medium-size companies
Large companies
creo q este me va a intresar
Software development companies versus companies with software developers
When a company’s focus isn’t software, typically software developers aren’t given as much respect and leeway.
companies whose livelihood is based on developing software are much more likely to put a high value on the software developers they hire.
**Taking action**
Take some time to think about what kind of environment you prefer working in.
Make a list of companies in your area or companies you have worked for and decide which category each fits into.

## Chapter 9. Climbing the corporate ladder

Taking responsibility
between more money and more responsibility. The right choice—at least in the long term—is almost always more responsibility.
One of the best places to search is in areas that no one else wants to get involved in.
Another way to indirectly take on responsibility is to become a mentor for others on your team.
How You Can Take on More Responsibility
Becoming visible
haciendo dos cosas. mandando weekly reports sobre mis logros conseguidos y dndo presentaciones n la hora de la comida sobre problemas q hay en el equipo
Becoming visible
How to Be More Visible
Educate yourself
You should always be learning something new or advancing your skills in some way.
Be the problem solver
What about politics?

## Chapter 10. Being a professional

What is a professional?
Being a professional (forming good habits)
Habits are an essential part of becoming a professional,
Another strong habit to develop as a professional is time-management skills.
Doing what is right
you’re often faced with many difficult challenges, both technical and ethical.
A professional assesses the work that has to be done, prioritizes it, and gets to work.
Seeking quality and self-improvement
The way a professional meets the high-quality expectations they have is by continuous self-improvement.

## Chapter 11. Freedom: How to quit your job

Going about things the smart way
You have to figure out a way to build up enough side income to support yourself while you get the new thing working.
Preparing to work for yourself
How much do you really work?
I found that I was usually getting only around 4 hours of actual work done during a day.
we only work half as hard when working for someone else.
Before you quit your job, it’s important to have realistic expectations of how much work you actually get done
Cutting the cord

**Taking action**
Calculate exactly how much money you’ll need to earn each month to live.
Start tracking your time every day at work.

## Chapter 12. Freelancing: Going out on your own

Getting started
You need to have existing long-term clients
and you need a steady stream of new clients coming in the door.
You have to cultivate these two situations over time.
Ask someone you know
Your goal should be to get to a point where you’re filling up all of the part-time hours you have allocated to this side business and you actively have to turn people away because you can’t take on any more work.
Best way to get clients

What you really want to focus on is what is called inbound marketing.
Inbound marketing is basically getting potential clients to come to you instead of you going out to find them.
blog.
Email marketing
Setting your rate
the rate you can charge is what the market allows you to charge.
The key is that I’m focusing on how my services will easily pay for themselves and more by the value I’m providing. It becomes an easy decision to hire me instead of someone cheaper who just talks about what he or she can do technically.

## Chapter 13. Creating your first product

Finding an audience
it will take some research to find a common problem that’s either not being solved or isn’t being solved very well.
la idea e justo ll contrario . primero crea una auduencia. lectores del blog. luego crea un producto q solucione sus  problemas 
create a product that doesn’t yet have an audience and then they try to shop the product around to find an audience.
Testing the market
por ejemplo. teniendo una pagina d venta antiipada . para ver si tu audienia eta dispuesta a pagar . john vendio prkmero su curo a umos ciantos y luego lo creo 
You should verify the product by testing the market and seeing if your potential customers are actually willing to pay for it.
Start small

Getting started
**Taking action**
Come up with some target audiences you could investigate to create a potential product for. Pick one of these audiences and find out where members of that audience congregate, online or otherwise.
Check who else may already be solving this problem.

## Chapter 14. Do you want to start a startup?

Startup basics

Go big or go home
A typical startup lifecycle
Accelerators
Getting funded

## Chapter 15. Working remotely survival strategies

The challenges of being a hermit
Challenge 1: Time management
The real solution to this problem is careful time management. You can work whatever hours you’d like to work, but set a schedule for each week and stick to it.
Challenge 2: Self-motivation
even if you can manage your time effectively, sooner or later, you won’t feel like doing any work.
Schedule and routine is very important to rely on for those times when you aren’t feeling all that motivated.
la rutin te ayuda a superr esos momentos en los a no te apetece hacer ada. ok. no te apetece pero etas acostumbrado a hacerlo. asi q lo hces
Schedule and routine is very important to rely on for those times when you aren’t feeling all that motivated.
Never rely on your own willpower to overcome temptation—this
when you’re feeling absolutely unmotivated,
set a timer for 15 minutes, and start working.
After 15 minutes of clear, focused work, you’ll probably find it’s much easier to keep moving forward.
I call this momentum.
Challenge 3: Loneliness

habla de curar la soledad 
So how can you cure this? I’ve got a simple answer here—get out!
spouse and kids don’t count.
joining a local software developer group
head to a coffee shop or café.
go to the gym

## Chapter 16. Fake it till you make it

situations that you aren’t qualified to handle.
people who choose to stay and fight have confidence in their ability to succeed and overcome? No,
though—they’re able to fake it till they make it.
What it means to fake it until you make it
I’m suggesting that you should act as if you’ve already succeeded at accomplishing a task or feat before you even begin
Putting it into practice
muy relaionda con sli de la zona d confort 
Faking it till you make it is all about purposely putting yourself in situations that are over your head and forcing yourself to learn how to swim.
The key is to be able to see ahead to how easy some task or situation will be in the future and act now as if it were then.
One common place where this applies to software developers is in the job interview.
la clav es que no son TODAVÍA . hay q ir con la confinz de q conseguiras esas skills
some of the skills that you’ll need to do the job aren’t yet in your possession.
Their vision is short-sighted, because they’re looking at things from the perspective of now.
it’s better to project an aura of confidence and capability, knowing that you’ve faced challenges in the past, you rose up to meet them,
Honest assessment time. What is your attitude in difficult situations?
How can you create a more confident attitude without appearing arrogant?
**Taking action**
Honest assessment time. What is your attitude in difficult situations?
How can you create a more confident attitude without appearing arrogant?
Bonus: Practice your strategy by going out and purposely putting yourself into a situation that is “over your head.”

## Chapter 17. Resumes are BORING—Let’s fix that

compaa un panfleto que anunia un excursion para tusbaaciones po 100€ con un cv para contrarte por 30000
A typical resume doesn’t compare to an advertising brochure.
You aren’t a professional resume writer
So why would you waste your time learning the skills of a professional resume writer instead of hiring one?
Hiring a resume writer
professional resume writer write your resume. And if you really feel uncomfortable about it, write your own resume and hire someone to “improve” it.
Going the extra mile
And here’s a list of really nice-looking, creative resumes that you can get some inspiration from: http://simpleprogrammer.com/ss-beautiful-resumes.
What if you don’t want to hire a professional?
Your resume should show what action you did and what result it produced.

## Chapter 18. Don’t get religious about technology

We are all religious about technology

The problem with being religious about technology is that most of us are religious about a particular technology because that technology is what we know.
Everything is good
It’s hard for a thing that isn’t at least good to become successful and to become widely known or used.
My conversion
Don’t limit your options
to have an open mind about technology and not simply hold onto what you already know, claiming it to be the best, you’ll find many more opportunities will open up to you.
**Taking action**
Pick one technology you hate and find someone who loves it. Ask open and honest questions about why they’re excited about that particular technology.
Section 2. Marketing yourself
Good marketing connects a need or want with a product or service that can fulfill that desire.

## Chapter 19. Marketing basics for code monkeys

What marketing yourself means
The real difference between great musicians and superstars is nothing more than marketing. Marketing is a multiplier for talent. The better marketing you have, the more it magnifies your talent.
What marketing yourself means
So marketing yourself is really connecting people who want what you have to offer with you.
The right way to market yourself is to provide value to others.
Whether you realize it or not, you’re marketing yourself all the time.
Why marketing yourself is important

Marketing yourself doesn’t guarantee success, but it’s a very important element that you can control.
you’ll likely find that you’ve reached a skill level that’s on par with many of the top developers. Many software developers can reach this level in their career in about 10 years.
The point is, don’t let not being an expert be an excuse for not marketing yourself.
How to market yourself
Marketing yourself begins with developing a personal brand—something
I consider a blog to be your home base on the internet.
this all depends on your ability to bring value to others.
The primary mechanism that you’ll use to get people to follow you and to want to hear what you have to say will be by bringing value to them—giving

## Chapter 20. Building a brand that gets you noticed

What is a brand?
A brand is a set of expectations about a product or service. A logo is just a visual reminder of a brand.
The key to the brand isn’t just the visual element, but what that brand makes you feel and what you expect when you interact with that brand.
What makes up a brand?

message, visuals, consistency, and repeated exposure.
A message is what you’re trying to convey and the feelings you’re trying to invoke with your brand.

use visuals everywhere it can.
if you don’t have consistency, you’ll never develop an expectation about your brand—or
consistent in the message they’re presenting or they lack consistency in how or when they deliver that message.
repeated exposure.
blogging, writing articles, speaking, creating videos, podcasting, or using any other medium
Creating your own brand
define your message, you’ll need to decide what you want to represent. You can’t be all things to all people, so you need to narrow down your audience and pick a niche.
You should start with a tagline
Steps for Creating a Brand Define your message. Pick your niche. Create a tagline. Create an elevator pitch. Create visuals.
**Taking action**
Brainstorm a list of niche ideas for your own personal brand. Come up with at least 10 to 15 ideas and then narrow down the list to your top 2 or 3. Try to come up with one that you’ll use for your personal brand.

## Chapter 21. Creating a wildly successful blog

Why are blogs so important?

I can tell more about a software developer by reading his or her blog than I can in almost any other way.
become a better software developer and communicator,
blog can bring many clients your way instead of you having to go out and look for them.
you can use it as a platform to sell your own product
reputation a successful blog can bring you in the industry.
one intangible benefit that isn’t easily dismissed is the improvement in your communication skills.
learning how to write might actually help you to write better code, because you’ll have an easier time communicating your intent.
Creating a blog
Keys to success
success as a blogger will depend on one thing and one thing only: consistency. I’ve talked to many successful bloggers and they’ve all had
success as a blogger will depend on one thing and one thing only: consistency.
You should also make sure you’re writing quality content.
Getting more traffic
start commenting on other people’s blogs.
Another good way to get some initial traffic is to, of course, share your blog posts on your social networks and put a link to your blog at the bottom of your email signature and anywhere you have a profile online. This
I can’t guarantee you success
**Taking action**

## Chapter 22. Your primary goal: Add value to others

if what you’re saying and the things you’re conveying don’t help other people, everyone will ignore you.
Give people what they want
It’s up to you, then, to figure it out for them.
you have to go out and see what people are interested in.
You might be particularly interested in a certain aspect of a framework or technology, but if your target audience isn’t, it won’t do you much good. On the other hand, if you strike a nerve with what you blog about or some content you create, you’ll know it pretty quickly.
Give away 90% of what you do for free
You’ll reach a much larger audience with your free
It will also give them a feeling of gratitude so that they may want to pay back to you some day by supporting a product you create.
The fast track to success
Every time you set out to do something, whether it be creating a blog post, recording a screencast, or another activity, you should look at it from the perspective of how it’s creating value for someone else.
Offering more of yourself
The more you help others, the more problems and situations you’re exposed to and the more connections you make.
**Taking action**
What kind of content do you find most valuable? Is there a particular blogger whose blog posts you read every single week or a podcast that contains such valuable content that you don’t ever want to miss an episode? What is the biggest value you can provide your audience or your niche?

## Chapter 23. #UsingSocialNetworks

Growing your network
to build up your social networks,
the easiest thing to do is follow someone else or ask them to join your network.
There’s no harm in ending a blog post with a call to action to follow you on Twitter.
It can take some time to build a large network, so don’t rush it.
Using social media effectively
cool to hot. You want to get people to go from follower to fan so that they’ll be more engaged in your content, share it with others, and actively promote you.
Again, it comes down to a matter of value.
Staying active
active, so how do I do it? I currently utilize a tool called Buffer (http://simpleprogrammer.com/ss-buffer), but there are many other tools out there that do the same thing. What Buffer does for me is allow me to schedule my social media posts all at one time.
I’ll create a mix of different types of content, and I’ll schedule all that content to be released at different times during the week.
Networks and accounts
You should obviously have a LinkedIn profile, because LinkedIn is really the social network for professionals.
**Taking action**
Come up with a social media plan. Decide what kind of content you want to share on each network and put together a strategy for sharing that content each week.

## Chapter 24. Speaking, presenting, and training: Speak geek

getting up in front of an audience and talking directly to them is one of the most impactful things you can do.
giving a presentation at work can be very helpful to your career.
Why speaking live is so impactful
there’s a personal connection you get when you attend a live event
Interacting in this way can build large amounts of trust quickly
Getting started speaking
It’s better to start small
One of the best places to start is by giving presentations at your own workplace.
You don’t even have to present yourself as an expert, but as someone who earnestly wants to help by sharing what you’ve learned.
Another easy avenue for public speaking is code camps and user groups.
you can find yearly code camps all over the world.
What about training?
Doing training, whether live or recorded, is another great way to build a reputation for yourself and even to make a little money.
Even though you might start out giving training for free—and free training is a great way to promote yourself—you might eventually want to start charging for the content you’re producing.
**Taking action**
Come up with a list of all the user groups in your area. Also come up with a list of any code camps that you might be able to speak at. Offer to speak at one of these events on a topic you feel comfortable talking about.
Try to create your own short training in the form of a screencast and publish it on a site like YouTube. Create a list of topics you could speak about.

## Chapter 25. Writing books and articles that attract a following

Why books and articles are important
When someone sits down to read a book, you’re getting their focused attention for a long period of time. A single book could take 10 to 15 hours
you have the ability to deliver your complete unabbreviated message to your readers.
Books and magazines don’t pay
you don’t write a book to make money. You write a book to increase your reputation.
Getting published
Not too many publishers want to take a risk on a completely unknown author,
you should have a solid proposal (or magazine abstract)
don’t worry about not being good at writing. It doesn’t matter if you’re good right now. What matters is that you start writing and you write consistently.
Self-publishing
More and more authors are finding success by self-publishing—especially
**Taking action**
Before you write a lengthy book, try to take on a smaller assignment like writing a magazine article.

## Chapter 26. Don’t be afraid to look like an idiot

have to learn to overcome one huge fear that most of us have—looking like an idiot.
You have to learn how to not be afraid to look like an idiot.
Everything is uncomfortable at first
things change. Over time the things that made you uncomfortable become second nature. You have to give it enough time
I’ll be honest with you, most people don’t make it.
Most developers won’t be willing to bear looking like an idiot for a short period of time in order to achieve something greater.
It’s okay to look like an idiot
como supera ese miedo? fácil . te la suda. te la suda lo q los demas piensen
Simple. You don’t even care.
what’s the worst that can happen if you end up looking like an idiot?
after it’s over, chances are no one will even remember it.
you want to succeed, you have to learn how to swallow your pride and get out there and not be afraid to make a fool of yourself.
Take small steps (or dive right in)
If you’re nervous about doing speaking, writing, or something else I mentioned in the previous chapters of this section, try to think of the smallest thing you can do
The point is to always be moving forward.
You’re going to feel uncomfortable, you’re likely going to be scared—possibly even terrified—but it will pass.
**Taking action**
Get brave. Today is your day. Go out and do something that scares you.
repeat the first action item at least once a week.
Section 3. Learning

## Chapter 27. Learning how to learn: How to teach yourself

if you constantly rely on someone else to teach you and never learn the skills to teach yourself, you’ll be greatly limiting your opportunities to advance your skills and knowledge.
Dissecting the learning process
We all tend to learn best by doing and teaching.
Teaching yourself
the best way to learn something is to jump right in and start doing, before you even know what you’re doing.
play is a powerful mechanism for learning.
We, too, learn by playing, by actively doing without really knowing what we’re doing.
Before you read a book on a subject, skim the book and dive right in and start playing around.
Once you’ve played around and you have all kinds of questions, only then go back and read the text.
Explore new areas and unlock new questions that need solutions.
Repeat this cycle
This way the information you acquire is meaningful to you, not just words on a page.
Finally, seal it all in cement by teaching what you’ve learned to someone else.
the key guiding principle is this idea of learning through play, experimentation, and teaching what you learned to someone else.
**Taking action**

## Chapter 28. My 10-step process

The idea behind the system
discovered that there were three main things I needed to know to be able to learn a technology:
1.  How to get started—What
2.  The breadth of the subject—How big was the thing
3.  The basics—Beyond
The 10-step system

What was the 20% I could learn that would cover 80% of my daily usage?
It turns out that getting those three pieces of knowledge isn’t as easy of a task as it might seem.
To solve these problems, I needed to do a bit of research ahead of time to make sure I could find the information I needed and organize it in a way that made the most sense for progression.
getting a basic understanding of what you’re trying to learn—enough
define the scope of what you want to learn,
find resources—and
create your own learning plan
Once you’ve done this legwork
you can take each waypoint
and apply the process of “learn, do, learn, teach” (LDLT)
steps 7 through10 are repeated for each module you end up creating in your learning plan.

**Taking action Take a technology you know well and see if you can define How to get started with it The breadth of that technology The 20% you need to know to be 80% effective using it**

## Chapter 29. Steps 1–6: Do these once

These first six steps will only be done once for each topic that you want to learn about.
Step 1: Get the big picture
Learning is always tricky,
Learning is always tricky, because
you don’t know that you don’t know.
It’s important to at least understand a little bit about a subject before diving into it.
do some basic research on the topic you want to learn about.
Don’t spend too much time on this step,
the goal isn’t to actually learn the topic here, but to just get a big picture of what it’s about and how big it is.
Step 2: Determine scope
it’s time to narrow down your focus to determine what exactly you want to learn.
in this step we put a reason for learning into a properly scoped topic.
try to be as focused as possible.
You can only learn one thing at a time.
Step 3: Define success
you should have a clear picture in your mind of what success will look like.
come up with a clear and concise statement that will define success
Good success criteria are specific, not ambiguous.
Good success criteria will also keep you on track by giving you a target to aimat.
Step 4: Find resources

try to gather many different resources to help you learn.
In this step you want to find as many resources as possible for learning about the topic you’ve selected.
similar to a brainstorming
Step 5: Create a learning plan
You need to skim through the material
and find a way to break down the topic into smaller sections.
It does you little good to learn random bits and pieces of information. You need to find the correct path that will get you from point A to point Z in the least amount of time,
For this step, you need to create your own learning path.
A good way to create your learning plan is to see how others are teaching the subject you want to learn about.
Step 6: Filter resources
decide what resources you’re going to use to accomplish the task.
**Taking action**
Pick a subject you want to learn about and actually go through the first six steps outlined here. You might want to start with something small, so you can get used to this process, but pick something.

## Chapter 30. Steps 7–10: Repeat these

learn, do, learn, teach (LDLT) formula. You’ll start off by learning just enough to get started. Then you’ll play around to learn and gather questions through self-discovery. After that, you’ll learn enough to do something useful. And, finally, you’ll teach what you learned
Step 7: Learn enough to get started
The key to this step is to not go too far.
Instead, focus on learning the minimal amount you’ll need to get started and to be able to experiment on your own in the next step.
skim material or read chapter summaries
Have you ever bought a new videogame
learn the basics and get right into playing the game.
Step 8: Play around
There are no rules.
You’ll learn through discovery and also develop plenty of questions.
With this approach, you learn by exploring and doing.
you’ll remember more of what you study, because what you learn will be important to you.
Step 9: Learn enough to do something useful
As you’re reading text, watching videos, having conversations, or doing whatever else is necessary to consume the resources you’ve chosen, look for the answers to the questions you came up with in the previous step.
Don’t be afraid to go back and play some more
Use the resources to help you teach yourself, driven primarily by the questions you’ve come up with by playing around.
Step 10: Teach

you only need to be one step ahead of someone to teach them.
teach what you’ve learned
fill in the gaps in your own learning as you try to explain it to others.
It’s a process that will cause you to really dissect and understand the topic you’re learning about in your own mind as you organize the information in a way that will make it understandable
take some time to take what you’ve learned out of your own mind and organize it in a way that someone else can understand.
You’ll also begin to make connections
don’t skip this step.
Final thoughts

## Chapter 31. Looking for mentors: Finding your Yoda

Mentor qualities
You should look for someone who has either done what you want to do—successfully—or has helped other people do what you want to do.
When searching for a potential mentor, put aside your own judgment and reasoning and look at results.
Where to find a mentor

Your best option is either someone you personally know or a friend of a friend or family member.
you might want to check local groups in your area.
A really smart move, if you’re interested in climbing the corporate ladder, is to look for a mentor in your own company.
Virtual mentors
create my own mentor—from books.
Obviously a real mentor is a better choice,
Recruiting a mentor

there’s no guarantee your mentor will want to take you on as an apprentice.
One of the best ways to accomplish this task is by offering something in exchange for help.
work for free.
Be persistent. Most people stop at the first “No.” Don’t be that kind of person.
**Taking action**
Sit down and think about why you need a mentor and what you hope to get out of a mentoring relationship.
Make a list of all the people you know who might be a good
Think of what you can offer a mentor in exchange for their help.

## Chapter 32. Taking on an apprentice: Being Yoda

Being a mentor
they only have to be one step ahead of a person in some area of life to help them.
Being a mentor isn’t about knowing the right answers all the time
Being a mentor is about looking objectively at another person’s problems and offering solutions they might not be able to see
Sometimes all you really need to do to mentor someone is pay attention.
To be a mentor you just need to be observant and patient.
The benefits of mentorship
When you take on the role of a mentor,
you revisit your own thoughts on a subject and see them through fresh eyes.
your answering of that question gives you a much deeper knowledge of a subject
Every person you help on their journey is a person who might someday surpass you and end up benefiting you
it will make you feel good.
Picking a “worthy” apprentice
When deciding on an apprentice, look for base qualities that you know will lead to success.
y q no se quiera aprovechar de ti
Look for a person who truly has a desire to learn and is willing to work hard to do it.
**Taking action**
Make a list of topics that you’re passionate about and have sufficient knowledge of to help someone else.
Go ahead and become a mentor.

## Chapter 33. Teaching: Learn you want? Teach you must.

I’m not a teacher
not all of us are trained in teaching methods, but everyone is capable of teaching.
More often than not, the real issue isn’t ability, but rather confidence.
The trick is that most of us teach without even knowing it. Teaching has such a formal ring to it, but really
The trick is that most of us teach without even knowing it. Teaching has such a formal ring to it, but really teaching is just sharing some knowledge with someone else.
What happens when you teach?
It’s very easy to fool yourself into thinking you really understand something—that is, until you try to teach it.
Teaching forces you to confront all the areas in your own knowledge that aren’t deep enough to be able to adequately explain them to another person.
you go from merely learning about a thing to understanding it.
The act of thinking about the best way to explain something and put it on paper, or into words or slides, causes you to put together the disconnected bits of information in your brain and reorganize them in a way that makes sense.
Getting started
I find that teaching is best approached from a humble perspective, but with an authoritative tone.
you do teach with confidence,
I’d recommend starting small
blog (did you read section 2?), which is a great place to teach what you’re learning without much pressure.
start giving presentations at local user groups or your own workplace.
keep that humble yet confident spirit—not
screencasts,
**Taking action**
Figure out a topic you can teach about and do it.
pay special attention to how your preparation to teach actually increases your own understanding of a subject.

other course you may want to pursue is professional certifications.

## Chapter 35. Finding gaps in your knowledge

Why we leave the gaps
That’s the problem with gaps
we tend to be too busy to stop and take the time to fill them in.
Finding your gaps
look at where you’re spending the largest amount of your time and any repeated tasks you’re doing.
Anything you’re doing repeatedly is worth a thorough examination to see if there’s something you don’t know that, if you did, might increase your efficiency.
You can keep a list of things you need to research or aren’t clear about
Filling the gaps
the key to filling in a gap is identifying it.
you can fill in a knowledge gap very quickly just by being willing to ask questions.
**Taking action**
For the next few days keep a pad of paper with you, and anytime you encounter something you don’t understand, write it down. Make a conscious effort to ask questions—even if they’re embarrassing—any time you don’t understand something in a conversation. Identify some “pain points” in your day and figure out ways you can get rid of them by filling in some gap
Section 4. Productivity

## Chapter 36. It all starts with focus

being productive doesn’t guarantee you’ll be effective.
What is focus?
Time seemed to fly by
Focus, like many things in life, is a game of momentum. It’s harder to get focused, but relatively easy to remain focused once you’ve pushed the ball up the hill.
The magic of focus
Getting more focus
fact, it’s pretty critical that you learn how to get focused,
you have to push through the initial pain of contorting your mind to a single task.
It’s not as easy as it sounds
Before you begin a task, make sure you have done everything you can to protect yourself from interruptions—both
survive the first 5 or 10 minutes. If you can make it to 10 minutes, chances are you’ll have enough momentum to continue.
**Taking action**
What caused you to get into that focused mode?
Pick a task that will take you a half hour or more and block off the time needed to complete that task, giving it complete focus.

## Chapter 37. My personal productivity plan

Overview
plan out my entire week in small tasks that take no more than two hours.
Kanban board
Pomodoro Technique to stay focused when I’m working on my tasks
Quarterly planning
I divide my year up into four quarters
I’ll try to come up with one big project that I want to get done during that quarter and I’ll also plan out some smaller goals.
I’ll create a high-level outline of what I want to accomplish during the quarter.
Monthly planning
try to plan out where I think work will fall on the days of the month.
I’ll simply take items from my quarterly outline and see what I can fit on the calendar.
Weekly planning
Every Monday morning, I’ll start my day by planning my week.
have a checklist I created in Evernote that lists everything I need to do each week.
I estimate how long it will take in pomodori
Once I’ve added the mandatory tasks for the week, I go through my calendar and see if there are any fixed appointments
I’ll slot in whatever work I plan to get done that week.
Daily planning and execution
I make sure that I work on the most important things first each day.
Dealing with interruptions
phone is never set to ring.
ignore email during the day.
email at one set time in the evening.
log out of or make myself unavailable on all the chat programs
Breaks and vacations
**Taking action**
Make a note of what you’re doing right now each week. See if there’s some way you can develop a system

## Chapter 38. Pomodoro Technique

If there’s just one productivity habit that I’d encourage you to develop, it’s the Pomodoro Technique.
Pomodoro Technique overview
Technically, if you finish a task early, you’re supposed to dedicate the remaining time to “overlearning.”
Using the Pomodoro Technique effectively
you can start thinking about your week in terms of a finite resource of pomodori.
The mental game
Pomodoro Technique is also very powerful because of the psychological impact time-boxing has on you.
We can’t necessarily control how long a task takes to complete. All we can do is control how much time we dedicate to the task—or
Pomodoro Technique also forces you to focus,
How much work can you get done?
My goal for the week is about 50-55 pomodori.
**Taking action**
chart how many you get done for an entire week.
Once you have an idea of how many pomodori you can get done in a week, set a goal for the next week

## Chapter 39. My quota system: How I get way more done than I should

The problem
repeated tasks that occur every single day.
big tasks that might take weeks or even months
Enter quotas
create a defined goal for how much progress I needed to make in a predefined time period.
I created a quota for everything I did that I needed to do more than once.
How the quota system works
Once you’ve defined what you’re going to do and how often you’re going to do it, the next step is to commit.
Make your quota higher or lower, but don’t adjust during an interval.
time to act—to
Pick a task that you came up with a quota for and commit to it.
Why the quota system works
productivity is maintaining a consistent pace.
**Taking action**
Make a list of all the tasks in your life that you repeat.
Pick at least one task and commit to a quota for a specific interval of time.

## Chapter 40. Holding yourself accountable

Accountability
It’s important to develop a sense of self-accountability to be productive when no one is looking.
Becoming accountable to yourself
To develop self-accountability, you need to first develop some kind of structure in your life.
habla de establecer unas reglas unos limites para saber cundo esta acieno lo q se supon q ien q estar haciendo
To develop self-accountability, you need to first develop some kind of structure in your life.
You need to create your own rules that govern how you’d like to live your life,
This added structure can help you to stay on task and do what you’re supposed to be doing
think about how you’d schedule your life and your activities each week if you didn’t actually have to do the activities yourself.
External accountability
It can be helpful to recruit an accountability partner—ideally someone who shares a similar goal.
**Taking action**
Decide how you’d like to live your life and spend your time and create some rules to help you ensure you’re heading in the right direction.
Create an accountability system that will help you to enforce your rules.

## Chapter 41. Multitasking dos and don’ts

Why multitasking is generally bad
Batching is much more productive
in general, I process all of my email at a single time during the day.
What about true multitasking?
it’s possible to combine a brainless task together with a task that requires some degree of mental focus.
**Taking action**
Cut out any multitasking that isn’t true multitasking.
Batch together any smaller tasks
Look for areas where you can implement true multitasking.

## Chapter 42. Burnout: I’ve got the cure!

How you burn out

we tend to get really excited and motivated about new things at first,
but then
despise them.
nos repugnan 
despise them.
the more work you get done, the faster you accelerate the pace of this feeling of being burned out.
In reality, you’re just hitting a wall
The truth is that most of us, in any endeavor we pursue, eventually hit a wall, a point where our initial interest and motivation have dropped off
On the other side of the wall
Remember that cure for burnout I promised you?
Push through the wall.
Notice what happens right after the wall, if you can manage to get through it? All of the sudden, results shoot up extremely fast.
Pushing through the pain is the secret to overcoming burnout.
Pushing past the wall
You might want to review chapter 40 on holding yourself accountable, but essentially, you need to create a set of rules for yourself that will ensure you keep moving forward.
**Taking action**
Decide that next time you take on a project, you’re going to take to completion or mastery. Set up rules and constraints that will force you to overcome the walls you’ll inevitably hit.
If you’re facing a wall of some sort in your career or personal life, try and push past it.

## Chapter 43. How you’re wasting your time

The biggest time waster of all
watching television!
Giving up the TV
TV programs short-circuit the problem-solving part of your brain
Everything
is directly influenced by TV.
Other time wasters
social media.
One good strategy, which applies to email as well, is to batch up your social media activities to one or two times during the day.
meetings.
One of the best ways to stop letting meetings waste your time is to simply not go to them.
Tracking your time
You can use a tool like RescueTime (http://simpleprogrammer.com/ss-rescue-time)
The best way to eliminate the time wasters in your life is to identify them.
**Taking action**
For the next week, meticulously track your time.
Have a “no TV” week and see how you do.
Figure out if you can buy back more time by hiring someone to do your yard work or cleaning for you.

## Chapter 44. The importance of having a routine

Routines make you
What you do every day defines and shapes who you are over time.
Creating a routine
A good routine begins with a big goal.
figure out how you can make incremental steps toward that goal
You’ll build your schedule around this goal.
next task is to actually schedule that time.
Getting more detailed
I’d highly recommend scheduling out your workday so that you know what you’re going to be doing each day and each week.
The more structured your day is, the more control you’ll have over your life.
**Taking action**
Track your daily activities and see how much of a routine you’re already following.
Pick one big goal and work it into your routine at least every week day. Calculate how much progress you’ll make in a year if you make a daily step toward your goal.

## Chapter 45. Developing habits: Brushing your code

Understanding habits
Habits basically consist of three things: a cue, a routine, and a reward.
A cue is something that causes your habit to be triggered.
A routine is something you do—the actual habit itself.
reward. This is the anchor that actually keeps the habit in place.
Recognizing bad habits and altering them
instead of trying to completely eliminate it, I can change the routine.
I could leave the cue in place and have the cue direct me toward another action—a more productive action.
a la hora de cambiar el mal hábito . busca otro hboto con recompens similar
try to find something that you can do that will carry a similar reward or even the same type of reward.
Forming new habits
forming new habits by just sticking with a routine long enough.
Once you’ve picked out a habit that you’d like to develop, think of a reward that will help motivate you to start the habit.
figure out the cue for your new habit. What’s going to trigger the habit? Make this cue something constant that you can rely on.
**Taking action**
What are the most influential habits that currently make up your life? How many of them would you consider good habits and how many would you consider bad habits?
Take one of your bad habits and try to turn it around into a good habit.

## Chapter 46. Breaking down things: How to eat an elephant

Why bigger isn’t always better
A large task can seem almost impossible when you look at it in its entirety.
otra razon por la q grandes tareas son mlas
The bigger a task, the less it tends to be defined.
Big tasks also tend to be very difficult to estimate.
Breaking down things
Breaking down large tasks into smaller ones
get more work done and to have more accurate estimates
How to break down things
you need to start by determining what steps need to be done to complete the task.
la clave aqui es .secuencial.
smaller sequential pieces.
Remember how I said that bigger tasks are usually less defined? A critical step of breaking down a large task into smaller ones is identifying what information is missing that’s preventing you from creating smaller,
Breaking down problems
**Taking action**
What large tasks are you avoiding right now because the size of them intimidates you?
Pick a large problem you’re facing now and see if you can figure out a good way to decompose it into smaller tasks.

## Chapter 47. The value of hard work and why you keep avoiding it

Why is hard work so darn...hard?
the work that we consider hard is the work that’s most likely to benefit us.
es como m comida. si est buen engorda
All the work that doesn’t have any benefit always seems so easy.
I’ll just work “smarter”
if we want to actually see results from our actions, we have to be willing to work hard.
Being smart isn’t enough.
Hard work is boring

why we avoid hard work, I’d say it’s because hard work is generally boring.
The reality
You might have to spend a few years of your career doing 60- or 70-hour weeks. You might have to forgo watching TV or hanging out with friends for a few years to pull ahead.
Working hard: How to do it
You just have to decide that you’re going to do the work that needs to be done.
You have to realize that the work must eventually be done, so it might as well get done now instead of later.
**Taking action**
What kind of hard work are you putting off? What
Get in the habit of not delaying, but immediately executing on work that needs to be done.

## Chapter 48. Any action is better than no action

Why we refuse to take action
too—the reason is pretty simple: fear.
Fear is probably the biggest reason that we refuse to take action when we know we should.
What happens when you don’t take action
What is the worst that could happen?
You should always ask yourself this question if you’re stuck on making a decision.
Even some seemingly important choices—life-altering ones—are better off left to a random roll of the die than indecision and inaction.
It’s easier to steer a moving car
Often not taking action is like sitting in a parked car and turning the steering wheel.
Sometimes, when you’re completely unsure about what to do, the best course of action is to do something and course-correct along the way.
What can you do now?
**Taking action**
If an action goal is too complex to decide on today, what smaller decision can you make to still move forward?
Section 5. Financial

## Chapter 49. What are you going to do with your paycheck?

Stop thinking short term
si cuanto mas gsnas . mas gsstss. es una gorma muy nala de pensar. solo te llevaa a la ruina
It’s a short-term way of thinking about finances that never lets us get ahead, because the more we make, the more we spend.
They were literally living paycheck to paycheck,
The more money they made, the more money they spent.
Assets and liabilities
asset, it has to be able to provide more dollars of value than it costs to own.
A liability, on the other hand, is just the opposite. It’s something that costs more than the value it provides.
You can think in the long term
around the idea of assets and liabilities.
si con tu suelo compras assets. cada ve tendras ma dinero porque los assets generan dineo... si con tu suelo compras liabilities. cad e tendra mnos dineo
When you have this viewpoint, you’re more likely to think in the long term rather than the short term.
Back to your paycheck
If you want to be financially successful, you have to learn how to invest.
**Taking action**
Follow the cash that goes through your hands every month.
Does most of your money go toward liabilities instead of investing in assets?
Start asking yourself “How much can I save?” rather than “How much can I afford?”

## Chapter 50. How to negotiate your salary

Negotiations begin before you even apply for the job

The more recognized your name, the more power you’ll have when it comes to negotiations.
How you get the job is extremely important
There are many different ways to get a job and
seeing a job posting and cold-applying to that job
This is, in fact, the worst way to get a job.
Another way to get a job is through personal referral.
you already have some credibility.
When the company that offers you a job finds you
First person to name a number loses
What about when you’re asked to name a number first?
The only exception to this is when an employer is purposely going to low-ball you.
you may want to name a number first to set an anchor point.
What about when you’re asked to name a number first?
What if you’re asked about your current salary?

intenar evitarlo. si hay q decir algo di. si es mas de lo que vais a ofrecer. no quiero ser descartado de un puestl interesante. si es menos. no quiero venderme barato 
What if you’re asked about your current salary?
When you have an offer
Once you have an offer in hand, you’ll almost always want to counter. What you counter with is up to you, but I’d highly recommend countering as high as your stomach will allow.
when you counter with your high counter, you’ll get back another response with a slightly higher offer. You can accept this offer, but in most cases, I’d recommend countering just one more time.
Some final advice
Know your numbers well. Research as much as possible what the salary ranges are at the company you’re applying for and what the salary ranges are for comparable positions.
A reason for the salary you’re requesting is never because you “need” that much money.
Instead, talk about why you’re worth a certain amount or what benefit you can bring to the table.
Talk about what you’ve done for past employers
**Taking action**
Practice negotiating as much as you can so that you can get over the fear of doing it.
Carefully research salaries so that you know what you’re worth.
Try to get a few interviews, even if you aren’t looking for a new job.

## Chapter 51. Options: Where all the fun is

Option basics
The basic idea behind an option is to allow someone to pay for the option of either buying or selling a stock by a later date in the future.
Digging a little deeper
Options basically give you the option to buy a certain number of shares of a stock by some date in the future for a fixed price. But you can also buy an option that lets you sell a certain number of shares of a stock by some day in the future for a fixed price as well.
Selling options
More complex options
**Taking action**
Look up a stock you’re familiar with and see if you can find what is called an option chain for it.
Take a look at the option chain and calculate how much it costs to buy an option on that stock that’s one month in the future.

## Chapter 52. Bits and bytes of real estate investing

Why real estate investment?
the biggest reason I’m going to suggest is stability.
the kind of income that’s stable about those kinds of properties is...rent.
If you experience a high period of inflation, but you’re holding a real estate loan,
your cash in the bank is diminished in value, your real estate loan is also reduced
en un perioo d inflaccion. tu dinero bajq. pero elnvalo d tu propiedad y el del lquiler sjbe
your cash in the bank is diminished in value, your real estate loan is also reduced at the same time as its price is technically increased, along with the rents.
Okay, so how do I do it?
real estate investment is a long-term investment.
buy rental properties that are either cash-flow positive or floating and to finance them using 30-year-fixed loans.
First step: Education
You make the most money in real estate investment when you buy—not when you sell.
there’s often a high disparity in pricing.
What’s the price of a house? Who knows?
It means that if you’re smart and diligent, you can buy real estate for a heavily discounted price.
The first thing you should do if you want to invest in real estate is to study the market.
thinking about what kind of offer you’d need to make to buy a property at a price that would be a good deal.
To do this you need to run all the numbers associated with a property.
**Taking action**

When I’m ready to buy a property, I’ll sign up to receive alerts from real estate agents on any new properties that meet my criteria.
almost always make a low-ball offer—one
pero cuando le acepptan la oferta bja . lo peta
That’s not to say that most of my offers don’t get rejected—they do.
Use property management
Finally, after you buy the property, my recommendation is to put property management in place. I highly recommend against managing a rental property yourself.
**Taking action**
look for a rental property listing in your area and practice running through all the numbers.

## Chapter 53. Do you really understand your retirement plan?

Retirement is all about working backwards
the most effective thing you can do to save for retirement is to figure how to reduce your monthly expenses.
nothing else is likely to benefit you more than figuring out how to live on less.
Calculating your retirement goal
with the monthly figure you need to live on to retire, you can officially “retire” when you reach that monthly income through passive income—that
Suppose you had 1 million dollars right now. If you wanted to invest that money into real estate,
You can’t live off of 1 million dollars if you don’t have 1 million dollars.
And here’s where two paths can diverge—especially
Path 1: 401(k), IRAs, or other retirement accounts
If you go down the road of using a tax-deferred retirement account like a 401(k), you’re in it for the long haul. You can’t really change your mind; otherwise you’ll pay a pretty big penalty for doing so.
Path 2: Setting up an early retirement or aiming to get rich
two paths are pretty much mutually exclusive.
You’ll basically be diverting funds away from the investments that you could be making in order to retire earlier.
you try to go down both roads, you’ll probably be doing both strategies in a suboptimal way.
You have to be able to make small investments that pay off, and work your way up to larger and larger ones over time.
There are three main ways to accelerate this process. First, and we already talked about this one, reduce your expenses.
Next, make as much money as you can.
Finally, make the most profitable investments you can.
What if I am stuck in the middle or close to retirement?
**Taking action**
Figure out how much you could reduce those expenses by if you were willing to make some big sacrifices.
calculate how much money you’d need to generate each month to retire
Figure out how much money you’d need to have at various rates of return, like 2%, 5%, and 10%, to have enough monthly income to retire.

## Chapter 54. The danger of debt: SSDs are expensive

Of all the financial mistakes you can make, the biggest one is to go into debt.
The only way you can really become financially successful is to make money off of your money.
Why debt is generally bad
esra seria la unica deuda buena
that debt is actually being used to get a higher return than the interest you’re paying on it,
Some common debt follies
The biggest folly I see concerning debt is saving money while holding debt,
the interest you’re paying on the debt you have is costing you more than the interest you’re making by having money in the bank—especially
Perhaps the next biggest debt mistake I often see is paying off debt in the wrong order.
Always prioritize your debt payments based on the interest rate.
the biggest one by far is unnecessary debt—that
Reverse the problem by saving and then buying things with cash.
Not all debt is bad
Debt can be good if you can use that debt to earn more money than the interest you pay on that debt.
Only in an absolute emergency situation should you take on debt that isn’t profitable.
**Taking action**
Make a list of all your debt. Put that debt into two categories: good debt and bad debt. Prioritize the list of bad debt by interest

Appendix A. If you can write code, you can understand finances
What is money?
Money is basically that intermediary. It represents some future utility or value.
Types of money
For money to have value, there has to be a limited supply of it.
prisons where the prisoners would use cigarettes as currency.
The problem with commodity money is that it doesn’t scale very well.
The U.S. monetary system used to be commodity-based when the dollar bill was backed by gold.
Fiat money is basically money that’s issued by a government that doesn’t have a direct relation to a specific commodity.
Inflation and deflation
You might have guessed that fiat money is pretty finicky. The value can change easily based on certain perceptions, and
it can be greatly manipulated in value.
el dinero pierde valor. y tu deuda sigue teniendo el mismo numeto. luego... tu deuda es menor
Inflation actually reduces your debt.
Deflation increases your debt.
Central banks
Fiat currencies need special care and handling to prevent inflation and deflation—or at least to keep them from becoming too extreme. That’s where the role of the central bank comes in to play.
They can essentially print money. Printing money has exactly the kind of effect you might imagine. It causes inflation.
Central banks can also reduce the circulation of money by selling government securities.
this would cause deflation,
The more money banks lend out, the less it’s worth—inflation, and vice versa.
What about “regular” banks
Typically, though, when you deposit $100 in your bank account, the bank lends around 90% of that out.

The bid price is the price that you can sell a stock at—it’s
The ask price is the price you can buy a stock at—it’s
This difference is known as a spread.
A stock that’s more liquid has a smaller spread, but a stock that’s less liquid has a larger spread.
The more people who trade a stock, the more liquid it usually is.
If you buy and sell a stock immediately, you’re almost guaranteed to lose money. As soon as you buy a stock, you’ve essentially taken a loss equal to the size of the spread.
These market makers set the bid and ask prices for a stock and make their money by collecting the difference.
How to make money in the stock market
Most stock market trading is based on speculation.
you can also make money when a stock goes down by a process called shorting.
When you short a stock, you borrow shares of that stock and sell those shares.
You eventually have to cover that short position by buying back shares to replace the ones you borrowed. If you buy back those shares at a lower price
